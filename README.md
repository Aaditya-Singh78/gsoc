This repository is created to hold every documentation generated during GSoC seasons for FOSSology project.

This website is built using [Docusaurus 2](https://docusaurus.io/), a modern static website generator.

## Installation

```console
yarn install
```

## Local Development

```console
yarn start
```

This command starts a local development server and opens up a browser window. Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server.

## Build

```console
yarn build
```

This command generates static content into the `build` directory and can be served using any static contents hosting service.

## Deployment

Once the branch is merged to `main` branch, it will be deployed with the help of Github Actions at https://fossology.github.io/gsoc/ .
