# Meeting 18
*(July 12, 2024)*

## Attendees

**Mentors:**

- [Shaheem Azmal M MD](https://github.com/shaheemazmalmmd)

**Contributors:**

- [Aaditya Singh](https://github.com/Aaditya-Singh78)

## Discussions:

**Mentors:**

- [Shaheem Azmal M MD](https://github.com/shaheemazmalmmd): Asked if having Aaditya's name in the `go.mod` file would affect the codebase.

**Contributors:**

- [Aaditya Singh](https://github.com/Aaditya-Singh78): Explained it wouldn't cause issues and can be updated using `go mod tidy` to adjust dependencies as needed.

Discussed applying the Hexagonal architecture principle, focusing on each module serving a single purpose and avoiding circular dependencies to improve processing efficiency.

Suggested creating a command-line interface for job control (pause, start, unpause), but noted that FOSSology already has a CLI for this purpose. Instead, proposed integrating the command parsing in `main.go` with an additional module directory.
