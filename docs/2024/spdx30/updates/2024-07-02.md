# Week 6 meeting and activities

_(July 02,2024)_

## Attendees

* [Abhishek Kumar](https://github.com/abhi-kumar17871)
* [Gaurav Mishra](https://github.com/GMishx)
* [Shaheem Azmal M MD](https://github.com/shaheemazmalmmd)

* [Akash Sah](https://github.com/Akashsah2003)

## Discussion

* Presented my work upon the tag:value report following the SPDX v3.0 JSON-ld report and previous SPDX v2.3 tag:value report.
* Also I discussed with [Gaurav Mishra](https://github.com/GMishx), regarding the Licensing Profile that are needed in the report and got a feedback that:
   - Simple Licensing Profile will be sufficient to define the license text and license expression in the file.
   - However, upon closer inspection for Expanded Licensing Profile, we need following fields as well:
        - seeAlso
        - ConjunctiveLicenseSet
        - DisjunctiveLicenseSet
        - NoneLicense
        - NoAssertionLicense
* Next Step: Will be working on the suggested fields by the mentor for the Licensing profile.

## Activities

* Finished working on the tag:value report for Core and Software profile.
