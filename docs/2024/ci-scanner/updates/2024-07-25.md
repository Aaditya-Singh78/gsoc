# Week 8
*(July, 19 2024 - July 25, 2024)*

## Meeting 1
*(July 24, 2024)*

## Attendees

* [Rajul Jha](https://github.com/rajuljha)
* [Gaurav](https://github.com/GMishx)
* [Avinal Kumar](https://github.com/avinal)
* Katharina


## Discussions
* Discussed potential improvements in the [#PR1](https://github.com/fossology/fossology-action/pull/1)
  with [Avinal](https://github.com/avinal)

* [Gaurav](https://github.com/GMishx) discussed in detail what we need to achieve with the download dependencies task.
  * The user should have ability to download dependencies for scan.
  * Then they can run fossology scanners on them in CI pipeline before hand to identify potential licenses and resolve them before hand.
  * We want to use the Cyclone DX toolkit for generating SBOMs of the repo.
    * Then use our custom written downloader for downloading the packages from the SBOM.
  * User needs to pass the language flag along with some `download-deps` flag or (something) since
    we are using language dependant tools.


## Work Done
* Completed refactoring the previous [#PR2754](https://github.com/fossology/fossology/pull/2754):
  * It follows the Don't repeat Yourself (DRY) principle.
  * Add type annotations to all the functions.
  * Add a new boolean flag `whole` that can be used to extract whole information from the scanners.

* Completed the licenses line number display in the CI in the same [#PR2754](https://github.com/fossology/fossology/pull/2754).

* Started working on documenting the new scanners features locally as discussed with [Shaheem](https://github.com/shaheemazmalmmd).

* Explored the scan dependencies part for the scanners. Need more clarity as to what exactly we need to achieve here.

## Planning for next week
* Plan out the structure and research in depth about the download dependencies task part.
* After structuring, need to plan out and flesh out the design details for the same.
* Start working on this next major task :)
