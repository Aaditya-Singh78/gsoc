## Work Done

* Completed the initial work on Fossology Action repository and sent out a [#PR1](https://github.com/fossology/fossology-action/pull/1) for the same.
* The new Github Action allows the users to scan using the fossology scanners ( `nomos`, `ojo` and `copyright` ) inside their Github Actions workflows in just a few lines of configuration.

```yaml
name: License scan on PR
on: [pull_request]
jobs:
  compliance_check:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    name: Perform license scan
    steps:
    - name: Checkout
      uses: actions/checkout@v2

    - name: License check
      id: compliance
      uses: fossology/fossology-action@v1
      with:
        scan_mode: ''
        scanners: 'nomos ojo'
        report_format: 'SPDX_JSON'

```

* User can scan in various scanning modes like `diff`, `repo` and `differential`.
* User can retrieve the scan results report as an artifact in Github Actions in various formats like `SPDX_JSON`, `SPDX_YAML`, `SPDX_RDF` and `SPDX_TAG_VALUE` by passing the format as an input with the action.
* The action also allows the user to pass various custom parameters like passing their own `keyword.conf` or `allowlist.json` file.

```yaml
scan_mode:
  description: "Specifies whether to perform diff scans, repo scans, or differential scans. Leave blank for diff scans."
  required: false
  default: ""
scanners:
  description: "Space-separated list of scanners to invoke."
  required: true
  default: "nomos ojo copyright keyword"
report_format:
  description: "Report format (SPDX_JSON,SPDX_RDF,SPDX_YAML,SPDX_TAG_VALUE) to print the results in."
  required: false
  default: ""
keyword_conf_file_path:
  description: "Path to custom keyword.conf file. (Use only with keyword scanner set to True)"
  required: false
  default: ""
allowlist_file_path:
  description: "Path to allowlist.json file."
  required: false
  default: ""
from_tag:
  description: "Starting tag to scan from. (Use only with differential mode)"
  required: false
  default: ""
to_tag:
  description: "Ending tag to scan to. (Use only with differential mode)"
  required: false
  default: ""
```

* Fixed some of the bugs in the previous PR's before they were merged.
* Got a review from [Gaurav](https://github.com/GMishx) to reduce code duplication at some places and try to maintain backward compatibility in the code.

## Planning for next week
* Refactor the code in the previous PR's to reduce code duplication (following the DRY principle) and better function handling.
* Try to complete the line number part for the scanner parts as well.
* Research about the next step for allowing the users to download scanned dependencies.
