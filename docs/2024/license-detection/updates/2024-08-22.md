# Meeting 13

*(August 22,2024)*

## Attendees:
- [Kaushlendra Pratap](https://github.com/Kaushl2208)
- [Ayush Bhardwaj](https://github.com/hastagAB)

## Discussion:

### Atarashi Integration and PR

- Code Ready for PR:

  1. Progress: Presented the latest results to the mentors. The Atarashi integration progressed well, and I created a [PR](https://github.com/fossology/atarashi/pull/103) after awaiting feedback from Kaushlendra. 
  
  2. Code Execution: The code allows for semantic search on a file by using the following command:
     ```
     atarashi -a SemanticSearch /path/to/file.c
     ```
     - Example output:
       ```
       {
           "file": "/home/jimbo/Desktop/GSoC24/atarashi/atarashi/license/licenseDownloader.py",
           "results": [
               {
                   "description": "",
                   "shortname": "GPL-2.0-only",
                   "sim_score": 91.0,
                   "sim_type": "SemanticSearch-LVD"
               }
           ]
       }
       ```

  3. Example Comments in the File:

### LLM License Text Identification

- Evaluation on Nomos Test Dataset:

  1. Approach: I evaluated Gemma 2 9b on approximately 200 samples from the Nomos Test dataset provided by Shaheem.
     - [Evaluation Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1zLjSyUyMCiAdoqnawbXqjpG209xRfvbCpTJRi4WlbDk/edit?usp=sharing)
  
  2. Results: The LLM was generally effective at extracting continuous license text sections, but had issues with edge cases where the license was interspersed with other content (such as HTML tags or commentary).
  
  3. Interesting Snippets:
     - **Example 1**: License text intermixed with HTML, where the LLM partially extracted the license correctly but missed sections due to the interruptions caused by tags.

        DOC software is provided with no support and without any obligation on

        DOC software is Y2K-compliant, as long as the underlying OS platform
        is Y2K-compliant.  Likewise, DOC software is compliant with the new US

        the United States that expand DST as of March 2007.  Since DOC
        software obtains time/date and calendaring information from operating
        systems users will not be affected by the new DST rules as long as
        they upgrade their operating systems accordingly. <P>

     - **Example 2**: The LLM extracted the license correctly even though the license information was embedded in a package description. This was deemed correct despite being less obvious.
  
        **File Comments**:
        ```
        # rpm-specific
        set(CPACK_RPM_PACKAGE_SUMMARY "${CPACK_PACKAGE_NAME}")
        set(CPACK_RPM_PACKAGE_DESCRIPTION "${PACKAGE_LONG_DESCRIPTION}")
        set(CPACK_RPM_PACKAGE_LICENSE "AGPL v.3.0")
        ```

        **LLM Response**:
        ```
        set(CPACK_RPM_PACKAGE_LICENSE "AGPL v.3.0")
        ```

     - **Example 3**: The LLM stopped extracting once it encountered commentary between license statements, which might indicate a limitation in detecting when a license resumes after an interruption.

        Distribution and modification of the the URW Garamond fonts are subject to the
        Aladdin Free Public License <http://www.artifex.com/downloads/doc/Public.htm>

        The font GaramondNo8 Italic has been modified, as compared with the version
        from the original distribution site <http://www.artifex.com/downloads/>;
        credits to Ralf Stubner for fixing the broken quotedblleft character.


        The TeX font metrics, virtual fonts and font definition files for URW Garamond,
        i.e., the files in the archive ugm.zip, may be distributed and/or modified
        under the conditions of the LaTeX Project Public License, either version 1.3 of
        this license or (at your option) any later version.  The latest version of this
        license is in http://www.latex-project.org/lppl.txt and version 1.3 or later is
        part of all distributions of LaTeX version 2003/12/01 or later.

        Various aspects of the font were subsequently improved and (contagiously)
        released under the Aladdin Free Public License.

        Finally, these fonts were converted by Gaetan Bisson to TrueType format using
        FontForge, for use in an X environment. No additional restriction applies.

        Files provided "as is", with no warranties.

  4. Observations: The LLM handles straightforward, continuous license text effectively, but struggles when the license text is broken up by other information or interspersed with unrelated comments. Overall this can be handled with additional prompt engineering

## Conclusions and Next Steps


- Documentation and Code Cleanup: Focus on documenting the entire project and cleaning up the code as the GSoC final evaluation approaches.
