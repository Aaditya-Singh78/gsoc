# Meeting 12

*(August 15,2024)*

## Attendees:
- No meeting held due to a national holiday.

## Discussion:

### Atarashi Integration and Build Process

- Build Errors and Code Integration:

  1. Approach: Fixed the errors with the Atarashi build process, successfully integrating the semantic search code into the codebase.
  
  2. Evaluation: Began evaluating the integrated semantic search agent within Atarashi. Some issues were identified where the agent missed certain cases, and efforts were made to refine these areas to improve performance.

### LLM Experimentation for License-Relevant Text Detection

- LLM Selection and Testing:

  1. Objective: Continued experimenting with various LLMs to determine which was best suited for detecting license-relevant text in code files.
  
  2. Results: Tested Mistral 7b, Gemma 2 9b, and LLama 3 8b. All models performed well in general, but from my experience, Gemma 2 9b was the best performer. While no formal metrics were used, Gemma 2 9b appeared to handle more nuanced cases better than the other two models. Being the latest release, this was not unexpected, but all models were largely able to detect the license-relevant text without significant issues.

## Conclusions and Next Steps

- Refine Atarashi Agent: Continue to work on refining the semantic search agent in Atarashi to address the missed cases and improve overall accuracy.

- LLM Selection: Focus on further experimenting with Gemma 2 9b for more comprehensive testing and continue exploring ways to quantify its performance in comparison to the other models.
