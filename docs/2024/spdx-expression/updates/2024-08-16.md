## Discussions

### API Work and Report Formats

- Presented my work on 6 APIs.
- Discussed the need to modify the `POST` endpoint at `/uploads/{uploadId}/expression/main` to ensure only cleared license expressions for any item in an upload can be added as the main expression.
- Received formats for CLI XML and unified reports, which will be updated accordingly.

## Activities

- Modified `Ojo` to prevent creating License Expressions for items with a single license.
- Modified `GET /uploads/{uploadId}/licenses/main` to include an optional boolean query parameter `includeExpressions` for retrieving main licenses including expressions.
- Modified `GET /uploads/{uploadId}/item/{itemId}/licenses` to include an optional boolean query parameter `includeExpressions` for retrieving license decisions including expressions for an item.
- Modified `GET /uploads/{uploadId}/item/{itemId}/clearing-history` to include an optional boolean query parameter `includeExpressions` for retrieving the clearing history including expressions for an item.
- Created `POST /uploads/{uploadId}/expression/main` to add license expressions as the main license for an upload.
- Created `DELETE /uploads/{uploadId}/expression/main` to remove license expressions as the main license for an upload.
- Created `PUT /uploads/{uploadId}/item/{itemId}/expression` to set license expression decisions for an item.
