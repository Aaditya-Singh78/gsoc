## Updates from contributors

- [Kavya Shukla](https://github.com/k-avy)
  - Done authentication for endpoints.
  - Added auth for all endpoints.
    - Suggestion is to add authentication for non `GET` endpoints like create license, update, get user, create users, etc.
    - The endpoints to get all licenses, license by shortname, search license should not have authentication.
    - Please check response status code and response body should have same code (like `401`).
    - Cleanup the code a bit.
  - Merge conflict resolution required for [#11](https://github.com/fossology/LicenseDb/pull/11).

- [Abdelrahman jamal](https://github.com/Hero2323)
  - Tried to generate dataset using FOSSology (instead of ChatGPT).
  - Scanned opensource projects to get data. But needed manual annotation, which is time consuming.
  - Could use [scancode-toolkit](https://github.com/nexB/scancode-toolkit) instead to annotate copyrights instead.

- [Soham Banerjee](https://github.com/soham4abc)
  - Focused on updating PR with changes requested.
  - Working on new endpoints for Customize page. Created `GET` endpoint, had discussion with mentor and will incorporate the changes suggested.
  - Worked on Conf endpoints as well. Need review from mentors.
  - Made the changes to have pagination in Copyright fetch endpoint [#2475](https://github.com/fossology/fossology/2475).
  - Suggestion from Avinal is to add some more descriptions to the issues created for the REST API project.
    - Could work more on the title (they currently have only short names).

- [Samuel Dushimimana](https://github.com/dushimsam)
  - Create endpoints for Standard License Comments and Acknowledgements.
  - Working on endpoint for Candidate license Merge and Dashboards.
  - Presented how the current pages looks like in the UI and what different endpoints will be needed to achieve the same results.

- [Sushant Kumar](https://github.com/its-sushant)
  - Absent.
