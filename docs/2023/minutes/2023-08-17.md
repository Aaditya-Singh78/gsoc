## Updates from contributors

- [Abdelrahman Jamal](https://github.com/Hero2323)
  - Completed project documentation for GSoC model.
  - Looking for low hanging fruits.
  - Found specific cases like `copyright <name>` which is missidentified. NER can help.
  - Will be working for edge cases using NER. But pretrained models are not accurate enough in detecting name and orgs.
  - Looking for smaller pre-trained models to use.

- [Soham Banerjee](https://github.com/soham4abc)
  - Working on Obligation endpoints. Some changes suggested by mentors on endpoint name.
