## Updates from contributors

- [Soham Banerjee](https://github.com/soham4abc)
  - Worked on update endpoint for customize page.
  - The GET endpoint now returns consistent type of data.
  - Will be working on file info page endpoints.
    - Found a bug in the customize page, integer fields are accepting strings.

- [Sushant Kumar](https://github.com/its-sushant)
  - Was working on different ways to run ScanCode with different parameters.
  - Integrated the changes for running ScanCode via API, demonstrated the same in the meeting.
    - Worked on copyrights for now. And found API is faster (13 seconds) than CLI (23 seconds) as shown in demo.
  - Still need to work on reading output from the Python script and updating DB.
  - Request from mentor is to push the updated code for ScanCode for recommending updates.
    - Also, to work on changes requested on CDX PR [#2507](https://github.com/fossology/fossology/pull/2507)

- [Kavya Shukla](https://github.com/k-avy)
  - Updated the meeting minutes.
  - License is almost finished, will be focusing on Obligations.
  - Work on audit is not done, but test cases is done for other endpoints.
  - Can discuss on E2E testing in next call.

- [Abdelrahman jamal](https://github.com/Hero2323)
  - Created a labled result for FOSSology's repo. The copyrights are color coded based on
    True Positive (green), False Positive (red), Different lang (blue), not actual copyright (grey), confusing (orange).
  - Used this data (14k +ve and 5K -ve) to train classifiers. Started with tf-idf and trained SVM, Random Forest, Navie Bayes.
    - NB can be told to have certial level of confidence before classifying a string.
  - Results are very good, >95% accuracy. Higher recall is aimed on identifying +ve copyrights.
  - Tested out Bert, but is slow and not very performant given the amount of data.
  - More data provided by the mentors.

- [Samuel Dushimimana](https://github.com/dushimsam)
  - Working on unlinking folders endpoints.
  - Updating existing PRs.
  - Next steps for the project will be to write testcases and migrate to v2 of API.
