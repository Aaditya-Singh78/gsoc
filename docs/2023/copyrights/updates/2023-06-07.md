## Attendees:

* [Abdelrahman](https://github.com/Hero2323)
* [Ayush](https://github.com/hastagAB)
* [Gaurav](https://github.com/GMishx)
* [Kaushlendra](https://github.com/Kaushl2208)

## Updates:
- I refactored some of the code in the copyright code.
- After some discussion with Ayush and Kaushlendra, we decided that some of the updates I made might not cover all the edge cases covered by the previous code and needed some modifications.
- I had struggled the week before with rebasing a branch to squash commits from the terminal and Gaurav taught me how to rebase a branch to squash commits.

## Conclusion and further plans:
- I should keep incrementally working refactoring the copyright code little by little.
- As soon as my exams end, I plan on getting started with working on the dataset itself, the main parts involve someway to determine the actual copyright script in a string and this will likely involve using Fossology as well as some annotation tools.
