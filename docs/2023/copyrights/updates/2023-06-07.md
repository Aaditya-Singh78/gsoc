## Updates:

### Refactoring
- Conducted a refactor of some parts of the copyright code.
  
### Discussion with Team
- Ayush and Kaushlendra provided feedback on my updates. We concluded that the refactored code might not comprehensively address all edge cases, warranting further modifications.

### Learning
- Gaurav provided guidance on how to rebase a branch for squashing commits from the terminalâ€”a valuable lesson after my struggles in the previous week.

## Conclusion and Further Plans:

### Incremental Refactoring
- I'll continue with the methodical refactoring of the copyright code, taking it step by step.

### Post-exams Focus
- Once my exams conclude, my attention will shift to constructing the dataset. The main challenge lies in accurately determining the inherent copyright script within a given string. To tackle this, I anticipate leveraging Fossology in conjunction with various annotation tools.
