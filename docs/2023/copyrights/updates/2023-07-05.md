## Updates:
- I showed off my partially cleared dataset of copyrights to my mentors and asked them to clear some of my doubts regarding whether a specific statement could be said to be a copyright statement or not. It's highly situational and the same statement in two different files, with different contexts, could mean two different things.
- I finished clearing the copyrights found in the tensorflow and kubernetes repositories, and they can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1wlenesocWRfWlz1nZjcNjwRCjBhS2s0NlvHoEwoIIMg/edit?usp=sharing) and [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1g8Xap3nZfb0gRJp4QPi9skpxKmFIL4ZJElYhO_s6MaI/edit?usp=sharing) respectively.
- Anupam suggested I use [scancodes](https://scancode-toolkit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) to retrieve the copyrights first, then write some script that compares the copyrights found by scancodes and the ones found by Fossology and that would help me in clearing the dataset. This is because scancodes almost never find the wrong copyrights, but in return, they don't find all the copyrights.
- Gaurav mentioned that I might be able to get a list of already cleared copyrights but it might take some time to get them ready.
  
## Conclusion and further plans:
- Look up scancodes and understand all the options related to copyrights
- Write a script that can use scancodes to retrieve copyrights
- Write a script that compares the copyrights found by scancodes and by fossology and uses that to label some of the dataset.
- Keep working on labeling the copyrights dataset.
