## Updates:

### Mentor Feedback
  - Presented my partially cleared dataset of copyrights to my mentors and sought clarification on ambiguous statements. The context in which a statement appears plays a crucial role in its interpretation.

### Repository Clearing
  - Completed the review of copyrights from the TensorFlow and Kubernetes repositories. The cleared copyrights from TensorFlow can be accessed [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1wlenesocWRfWlz1nZjcNjwRCjBhS2s0NlvHoEwoIIMg/edit?usp=sharing) and those from Kubernetes are available [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1g8Xap3nZfb0gRJp4QPi9skpxKmFIL4ZJElYhO_s6MaI/edit?usp=sharing).

### Scancodes Tool
  - Anupam recommended using [scancodes](https://scancode-toolkit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) to first retrieve copyrights. The subsequent step would be to develop a script to compare copyrights discovered by scancodes with those identified by Fossology. The advantage of scancodes is its accuracy, even though it might not capture every copyright.

### Cleared Copyrights List
  - Gaurav indicated the possibility of obtaining a list of pre-cleared copyrights, although its preparation might necessitate some time.

## Conclusion and Further Plans:

### Scancodes Familiarization
  - Delve into scancodes to understand the options pertinent to copyrights.

### Script Development
  - Develop a script to harness scancodes for retrieving copyrights.
  - Design a script that juxtaposes copyrights detected by scancodes with those by Fossology to assist in dataset clearing.

### Dataset Labeling
  - Persist in annotating the copyrights dataset.
