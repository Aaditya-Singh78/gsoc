## Attendees:


## Updates:
- I was visiting family and couldn't attend this meeting.
- I'm finally done with my finals.

## Conclusion and further plans:
- I'll work on creating the dataset for the next few weeks until we have enough training and test data to start working on the machine learning model.
- I'll also work on implementing the LDA (Latent Dirichlet Allocation) model that Kaushl told me to work on.
