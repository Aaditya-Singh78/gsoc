## Attendees:


## Updates:

### Holiday Break
- This week's meeting was postponed due to the celebration of Eid al Adha, a prominent religious and public holiday in Egypt. With the consent of my mentors, the meeting was deferred. 

### Library Exploration
  - I ventured into the exploration of libraries that Gaurav proposed in our last discussion. After trying the Fossology Python library, I gravitated towards using the Python requests library directly. The code employed for dataset creation can be accessed [here](https://gist.github.com/Hero2323/7ed99af2e336216860ad74e6002de5db). For utilization, it necessitates the upload of the software repository to Fossology via the user interface initially. Subsequently, my code aids in extracting copyrights, collating them in a CSV, and preserving them.

### Dataset Clarification
  - During the week, I concentrated on discerning the method to categorize the text yielded by the Fossology API into false positives or true positives.

## Conclusion and Further Plans#

### Dataset Clearing
  - Aim to refine the dataset curated through various software repositories, inclusive of Fossology's repository. The intention is to present the outcomes to the mentors in the impending week.
