## Attendees:


## Updates:
- This meeting coincided with Eid al Adha, which is a religious and public holiday in Egypt, with permission from my mentors, There was no meeting this week.
- I started exploring the libraries that Gaurav suggested last week. I tried out the Fossology python library but opted to just use the python requests library manually. The code for dataset generation can be found in [here](https://gist.github.com/Hero2323/7ed99af2e336216860ad74e6002de5db). It requires that the user uploads the software repository to fossology using the UI first, then use the code that I wrote to retrieve the copyrights, put them in a csv and save them.
- Throughout the week, I worked on understanding how to clear the text produced by the Fossology API as either a false positive or true positive.

## Conclusion and further plans:
- Work on clearing the dataset which I created using multiple software repositories, including Fossology's, and show off my results to the mentors next week.
