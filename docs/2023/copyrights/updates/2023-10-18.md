## Updates:

### 1. **Re-evaluation of the Existing Model**:
  * Upon a thorough review of the previously developed decluttering model, I identified a significant issue in the approach I adopted. Specifically, the semi-supervised learning technique utilized earlier had not been applied with adequate scrutiny to the dataset. As a result, the dataset contained an excessive number of inaccurately labeled examples, adversely affecting the model's performance.

### 2. **Data Labeling and Refinement**:
  * To rectify the identified discrepancies, I undertook the task of labeling a new dataset comprising 4,000 diverse examples. This process was assisted by the model to ensure the accuracy of labels. The objective was to establish a robust dataset, devoid of labeling errors, which could be reliably used to gauge the model's performance.

### 3. **Optimization Strategy**:
  * During this labeling phase, I adopted a systematic strategy to mitigate the recurrence of previously observed issues, particularly the repetitive copyright statements. Consequently, this dataset, though numbering 4,000 examples, effectively offers the richness of approximately 6,000 to 7,000 samples when benchmarked against the former labeling methodology.

### 4. **Putting the Model to Test**:
  * I decided to evaluate the refined model on new datasets - copyrights from ansible, cassandra, and vscode repositories:
   - **Ansible**: Here, the results were mixed. While the model performed reasonably in some cases, it exhibited challenges in accurately identifying GNU license instances:

   - **Cassandra**: Again, the model demonstrated varied performance. While it succeeded in some instances, it missed out on others, particularly the ones with repeated patterns:

   - **VScode**: A similar trend was observed here. Some instances were accurately identified, whereas others were overlooked:

   - **Feedback Session**: After showcasing these outcomes to Kaushlendra, he articulated that the model would greatly benefit from an even more expansive dataset. A corpus larger than the current 4,000 examples is essential for the model to effectively generalize across diverse variations.

## Conclusion and further plans:

### 1. Decluttering Improvements
- Improve the decluttering model as much as I can while working on the documentation

### 2. Documentation
- Work on finilzating the weekly documentation as GSoC is coming to an end.
- Start working on the GSoC final report.
