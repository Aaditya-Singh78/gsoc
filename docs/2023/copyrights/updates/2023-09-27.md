## Updates:

### 1. Decluttering Strategies:
   - I have considered two distinct strategies for decluttering using NER (Named Entity Recognition):
     - **Simpler Approach**: Identifying the entire copyright as a single entity.
     - **Detailed Labeling**: Recognizing and labeling individual components within the copyright. This includes symbols like `(c)`, `(C)`, and `Â©`, the term `copyright`, the copyright holder's name, the year/date, among other constituents. Although this method requires more extensive labeling, it promises potential benefits in accuracy and granularity.
   - I opted for the simpler approach and proceeded with manually labeling 600 instances via doccano. Subsequently, a rudimentary spaCy model was trained on this labeled data.

### 2. Model Testing:
   - Here are some samples tested with the developed model, where the highlighted parts denote detected copyrights:
     1. **`Copyright (c) 1997-2000 PHP Development Team (See Credits file)`** |\n"); ibase_blob_add($bl_h, "+----------------------------------------------------------------------+\n"); ibase_blob_add($bl_h, "| This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify |\n"); ibase_blob_add($bl_h,
     2. **`copyright 1996 by SPI`**
     3. **`Copyright (c) 2004-2011, The Dojo Foundation`** All Rights Reserved. Available via Academic Free License >= 2.1 OR the modified BSD license. see: http://dojotoolkit.org/license for details
     4. **`Copyright (C) 2003-2004 Lawrence E. Rosen.`** All rights reserved. Permission is hereby granted to copy and distribute this license without modification. This license may not be modified without

   - Overall, the model displays adeptness in detecting the copyrights and filtering out the clutter, with some notable exceptions, like the fifth example.

### 3. Integration Efforts:
   - With Gaurav's assistance during our recent meeting, we managed to pinpoint some integration issues. After overcoming them, the integrated feature was activated, although it ran at a significantly diminished speed. The reason for this reduced efficiency is yet to be determined.

## Conclusion and Further Plans:

### 1. Model Enhancement:
   - The immediate plan is to supplement our dataset with additional labeled data points. With this augmented dataset, the aim is to further improve and refine the declutter model.
