## Attendees:

* [Abdelrahman](https://github.com/Hero2323)
* [Ayush](https://github.com/hastagAB)
* [Gaurav](https://github.com/GMishx)
* [Kaushlendra](https://github.com/Kaushl2208)


## Updates:

### 1. **Resolution of Integration Issues**:
  * After Gaurav's timely intervention, we got the decluttering integration issues sorted out. He pointed out the exact changes needed in the PHP code and even provided the code snippets to fix the problem.

### 2. **Weekly Documentation**:
  * This week, I pivoted towards updating the documentation, a task that had been relegated to the backburner in the preceding weeks.

### 3. **Decluttering Performance**:
  * With the decluttering component now integrated and debugged, I delved into a thorough discussion with Gaurav regarding its performance. While the current results are promising, there's significant room for improvement. 
    * The primary challenge lies in the intricate nuances and variations of clutter present in different repositories. If our model fails to recognize a particular pattern, it subsequently overlooks similar patterns across multiple instances.
    * A case in point is a recurrent copyright missed in the Ansible repository:
      * `Copyright 2019 Ansible Project GNU General Public License v3.0+ (see COPYING or https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.txt)`
    * This pattern, accompanied by the GNU license text, manifested in several variants. Since our model couldn't identify this particular instance, it consistently missed out on similar patterns throughout.

## Conclusion and Further Plans:

### 1. Enrich the labeled dataset
  - By introducing a diverse range of examples, I hope to enhance the model's ability to generalize more effectively across varied inputs. This step is critical to elevating the decluttering model's accuracy and adaptability in real-world scenarios.
