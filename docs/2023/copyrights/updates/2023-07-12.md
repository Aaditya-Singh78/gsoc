## Updates:
- I wrote two scripts, one that uses the Scancodes library to retrieve the copyrights in a directory, which can be found [here](https://gist.github.com/Hero2323/5364aa4c474c7b86702de56fe4d42d09), and one which compares the copyrights found by the Scancodes library and Fossology, which can be found [here](https://gist.github.com/Hero2323/da410d4f06547ef3b4bdb626bbde868b).
- As it turns out, the scancodes library doesn't retrieve the copyright text as is from the file that it found it in, it instead searches for copyrights and then reconstructs them using some internal grammar rules, which means that I had to experiment a little with the comparison code, like changing the copyright symbol Â© to (c), (C) & copyright (c). There are further examples in the second gist.
- I was almost done with clearing the copyrights found in the Fossology repository, which are very varied and required way more attention than the other repositories.
  

## Conclusion and further plans:
- Finish clearing the Fossology Repository copyrights.
- Start working on copyright classification.
