## Updates:

### Discussion Topics
- We went over the proposal content and also delineated the feature timeline for the project. 

### Scheduling Consideration
- Considering my upcoming finals from the 28th of May to the 13th of June, the team decided that the first three weeks of the coding period will be dedicated to addressing minor issues with the previous project developed by Kaushlendra.

### Dataset Creation
- Talked about the generation of a new dataset, with a primary focus on sourcing from a prominent open-source project - [Fossology](https://github.com/fossology/fossology). We're also contemplating expanding the data sourcing to other significant open-source endeavors.

### Model Recommendation
- Kaushlendra proposed the exploration of the [Latent Dirichlet Allocation](https://towardsdatascience.com/latent-dirichlet-allocation-lda-9d1cd064ffa2) as a potential machine learning model.

## Conclusion and Further Plans:

### Immediate Priorities
- The ensuing two weeks will see me making minor tweaks and improvements to Kaushlendra's initial false positive copyright project.

### Post-exams Focus
- Once the exams conclude, I aim to delve deeper into understanding the LDA model, as suggested by Kaushlendra, and will also commence the dataset creation process.
