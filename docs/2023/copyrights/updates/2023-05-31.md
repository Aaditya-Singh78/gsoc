## Updates:
- We had some minor discussions about the content of the proposal.
- We discussed the feature timeline to be followed on the project and as I had finals starting on the 28th of May and ending on the 13th of June, everyone agreed that for weeks 1 & 2 of the coding period, only minor fixes to the previous project as implemented by Kaushlendra will be made.
We discussed the creation of the new dataset to be used and that it will be created for at least one large open-source project [Fossology](https://github.com/fossology/fossology) and possibly other large open-source projects as well.
- **Kaushlendra suggested one possible machine learning model to be used which is the [Latent Dirichlet Allocation](https://towardsdatascience.com/latent-dirichlet-allocation-lda-9d1cd064ffa2).**

## Conclusion and further plans:
- Throughout the next two weeks, I'll be implementing minor fixes to the original false positive copyright code.
- After the finals are done, I'll read more about the LDA model as suggested by Kaushlendra and start working on creating the dataset.
