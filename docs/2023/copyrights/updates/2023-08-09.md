## Updates:
   

#### Datasets & Findings:

- **Dataset Corrections**: This week commenced with a detailed inspection of datasets which led to the rectification of various errors. The corrected datasets and predictions from the current model have been updated in [this spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/132NnbJT4nqb-hxPX-XRFvUWTUg9SW0-ueW2YkpykgSk/edit?usp=sharing).

- **Inconsistencies Addressed**: I found that the treatment of separate language rows varied across datasets. To maintain consistency, all such records have been treated as copyrights, requiring manual intervention later.

- **Annotating Mistakes**: Through model predictions, I detected errors in dataset annotations. These errors have been fixed and the updates can be found in the aforementioned spreadsheet.

- **Dataset Merging**: Given the presence of different languages across datasets, I decided to consolidate all datasets for training, setting aside 20% for testing. The new dataset comprises:
  - **Class 0 (copyrights)**: 75.22% (16377 rows)
  - **Class 1**: 24.77% (5393 rows)
  - **Total rows**: 21770

- **Additional Dataset**: Gaurav has provided an additional dataset comprising 26188 unique rows. I've yet to label this dataset.
   

#### Model Performance:

- **TF-IDF Vectorizer**: The model achieved significant results using the TF-IDF vectorizer, without additional preprocessing:
  - Class 0 misclassifications: **0.32%** (52 out of 16377)
  - Class 1 misclassifications: **0.61%** (33 out of 5393)

- **Preprocessing Enhancements**: I devised a preprocessing function which improved the model's performance. These enhancements include replacing digits, copyright symbols, emails, and more. This approach reduced the misclassifications:
  - Class 0: **0.26%** (43 out of 16377)
  - Class 1: **0.82%** (44 out of 5393)

- **TF-IDF Parameter Tweaking**: Further fine-tuning of TF-IDF parameters allowed the model to achieve:
  - Class 0 misclassifications: **0.16%** (27 out of 16377)
  - Class 1 misclassifications: **0.54%** (29 out of 5393)

- **Thresholding at 0.99**: Applying a threshold of 0.99 rendered impressive results:
  - Class 0 misclassifications: **0.03%** (5 out of 16377)
  - Class 1 misclassifications: **4.6%** (248 out of 5393)
   

#### External Datasets Testing:

- **Fossology-provided-2 dataset**: Initial results on this dataset indicated:
  - Class 0 misclassifications: **0.46%** (27 out of 5808)
  - However, after manual inspection, only 12 were genuine misclassifications.

- **Dataset from Paper**: I tested the model on the dataset from [this paper](https://doi.org/10.1587/transinf.2020EDL8089). The results were:
  - Class 0 misclassifications: **0.09%** (2 out of 2146)
  - Class 1 misclassifications: **1.32%** (2 out of 151)
  - Notably, the two misclassifications in class 1 were found to be correctly predicted by our model.
   

#### Feature Extraction & LDA:

- **Feature Extraction from Paper**: Implementing the paper's feature extraction method yielded the following results:
  - Class 0 misclassifications: **2.91%** (477 out of 16377)
  - Class 1 misclassifications: **6.93%** (374 out of 5393)

- **LDA Analysis**: Leveraging LDA, I identified the 20 most frequent words in each class, offering insights for potential feature extraction enhancements.
   

#### Language Detection:

- **cld3 Limitation**: Although `cld3` proved efficient, its `Apache License 2.0` is incompatible with Fossology's `GNU General Public License v2.0`.

- **spaCy's Model**: Despite utilizing spaCy's language detection model, many English rows were misclassified as non-English and vice versa.
   

#### GitHub Repository:

- I've established a [GitHub repository](https://github.com/Hero2323/Fossology-Reducing-Copyrights) to store all project files.
   

## Conclusion & Future Plans:

### Language Detection
  - Investigate more efficient language detection methods.

### Preprocessing Improvements
  - Enhance preprocessing by using NER for name and organization replacements.

### Feature Extraction
  - Delve deeper into feature extraction techniques.

### Documentation
  - Cleanup my documentation
  - Cleanup and update my GitHub repository.
