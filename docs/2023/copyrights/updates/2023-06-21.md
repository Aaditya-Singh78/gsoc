## Updates:
- I started working on creating a dataset of copyrights. Instead of doing it manually through the fossology UI, I thought about automating it using chat-gpt-3.5 API. I created a set of functions that go through a directory, extract all the commented text inside each file and send that text along with a prompt to the chat-gpt API telling it to return the copyright statement found in that text. It worked for the most part and I spend most of the week iterating on this process and improving it. The code can be found [here](https://gist.github.com/Hero2323/bff12400cec5ab54467ea35ba89e976f) and my results can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/10cvdBEWOgr2JSWqR7X7Oz0xl-Nn2VcGU?usp=drive_link).
- As it turns out, while this approach was interesting, it's not usable in this project because to correct the false positives that fossology produces, I need to produce the dataset using fossology and not something external.
- I was informed that there is a Fossology API that can be used to extract the copyright statements generated by fossology and that I can use it for the dataset creation part.
- I also worked on implementing a simple LDA (Latent Dirichlet Allocation) model with two topics, copyright & no-copyright and it was somewhat successful and detecting which words and documents are associated with copyright statements. The code for this part can be found [here](https://gist.github.com/Hero2323/3e22bc0af40323d502de6f26ef2886ab)

## Conclusion and further plans:
- Work on creating the dataset using the Fossology API.
