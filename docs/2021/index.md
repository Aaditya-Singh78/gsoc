2021 was the 4th year FOSSology participated in
[Google Summer of Code](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/organizations/6095425418821632/).

This year, we had 7 amazing students working with us and spending their summer
contributing to the Open Souce. The contributions made to the project are
superb and will help FOSSology to grow as a richer tool and ecosystem.

### Photo
Due to tough situations this year, we could not meet anyone in person despite
being in same place sometimes. But with the help of technology, we managed to
capture this screenshot of our concluding call with every student and mentor.
