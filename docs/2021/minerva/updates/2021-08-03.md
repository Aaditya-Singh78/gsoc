### Discussions
1. To implement itertools combination for initial splitting of licenses.
2. This approach works well for licenses less than 20 paras but not for larger licenses.
3. Reuse the [Split](https://github.com/hastagAB/SPDX-OSS-Dataset/pull/1/commits/24ce5ddc16aa4d23d99c34180994a9dddcb8feca) script.

### Week-8 Progress
1. Implemented itertools and ngram on two different length licenses in [notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1V_tKjdpfuOqZxIpwYk7MNVZE_sjZYhrK?usp=sharing)
2. Downloaded SPDX released licenses, licenseListVersion:3.14 and implemented my script on these licenses.
3. Updated [Minerva-Dataset](https://github.com/SinghShreya05/Minerva-Dataset-Generation) repository.

## Conclusion and Further Plans
To get a count of all the license files generated using different approaches for intial split.
