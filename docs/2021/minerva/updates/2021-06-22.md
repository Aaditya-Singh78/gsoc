## Discussions
1. Using Nomos for baseline validation of generated text files of licenses and compare results.
2. To improve regex expansion, different algorithms were discussed. 
3. Results from Markov were discussed and how to improve it so that coherent statements can be generated. 

## Week 2 Progress
1. Generated Motosoto files using the Markov approach was validated using Nomos.
2. Implementation of the "n-gram" approach on regex of different licenses so as to generate coherent regex statements.
3. Extracted License header and regex from the STRINGS.in file and stored them in separate CSV files for SPDX and LT.
4. Worksamples : [License-Regex](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/2/folders/1ObmkfCON3VK6CCq3yovTn7xe1hIL2zaZ), [GeneratedMotosotoLicense](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/2/folders/1q6F-kXVEJdfjHzUppGQIloK_qEeRZflF), [FileGenerationUsingMarkov](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1bR3O98q3k2oMq-cOg_-1F8QcJe3gpmDG?usp=sharing)

## Conclusion and Further Plans
Implement n-gram approach to Motosoto licenses, so that the performance of Markov and Ngram algorithms can be compared.
