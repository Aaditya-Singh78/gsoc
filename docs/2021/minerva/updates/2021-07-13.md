2. As in last week it was discussed to apply the generation part to all the licenses currently in fossology database, this part was done and the results of which were discussed.
3. Research and implement other NLP algorithms that can be used either in data validation or generation.

### Week-5 Progress
1. Extracted license headers and their text of licenses present in Fossology database from [JSON](https://github.com/SinghShreya05/Minerva-Dataset-Generation/blob/main/Download-licenses-Script/database-foss.py)
2. Implemented [Script](https://github.com/SinghShreya05/Minerva-Dataset-Generation/blob/main/Download-licenses-Script/database-foss.py) to download the licenses.
3. Created [Minerva-Dataset](https://github.com/SinghShreya05/Minerva-Dataset-Generation) repo, and pushed all my progress so far in dataset generation and validation of licenses.

## Conclusion and Further Plans
To discuss the nomos validated results with the mentors and proceed with Augly implementation.
