### Week 5 Progress

- CMake Installation Configuration is almost complete.
- FOSSology can be installed completely via CMake
- Post install script generation also added
- To test the current progress, follow the instructions <a href="https://github.com/avinal/FOSSology/wiki#test-the-new-system-only-gcc-with-make-and-ninja-tested-for-now">here</a>


### Discussions

- There are permission problems while running bash script of `nomos`, `monk` and `genvendor`.

  - One possible fix can be to add `bash` before each bash scripts. 
  - The other fix is to modify shebang line in each script from `#!/bin/sh` to `#!/bin/bash`.

- In copyright agent same files are being compiled thrice, this is slowing down the build.

  - I am working on it. The problem is occurring because of three different executables. 
  - I will try to combine the common objects together.

- There are some redundant files in the installation. And VERSION file is missing in `/usr/local/share/fossology`. 

### Conclusion and Further Plans

- Fix copyright build.
- Remove redundant files and folders.
- Fix permission issues.
