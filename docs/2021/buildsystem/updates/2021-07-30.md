### Week 8 Progress

- CMake Packaging configuration almost completed.
- Packages can be built according to the FOSSology previous packaging structure.
- Initial testing configuration added.
- Ninja build has been fixed.
- To test the current progress, follow the instructions <a href="https://github.com/avinal/FOSSology/wiki#test-the-new-system-only-gcc-with-make-and-ninja-tested-for-now">here</a>


### Discussions

- **How is the testing implemented in FOSSology?**

    - Not all agents have testing implemented.
    - There are two types of tests *Unit* and *Functional*.
    - At first, the test executable calls multiple PHP scripts to create a test environment. And then tests are executed. 
    - Files related to testing and common for all the agents are in `src/testing`
    - Other tests depends on `phpunit`. This *PHPUnit* is generated inside `vendor`.

- **As of now, the testing configurations are hardcoded, what should I do, because it seems the testing configuration will require changes to a lot of files?**

    - Decide a deadline for the testing configuration and if until that point there is not very productive implementation then move to the next task that is implementing CI.
  
- As of now building, installation, and packaging via CMake is working and in a stable state. To create an initial Pull Request. This would also be useful in case of the final evaluation and further testing will be based on this PR itself.

- Fix any bugs or if there is the scope of improvement in Building, Installation and Packaging do that. 

    
### Conclusion and Further Plans

- Prepare for an initial PR.
- Fix known bugs and apply Improvements.
- Work on testing configurations.
