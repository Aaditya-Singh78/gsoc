## Meeting 4
*(June 18th, 2021)*

In this fourth meeting, a lot of questions were discussed related to the existing build system and what things we have to drop or modify.

### Week 2 Progress

This week was mainly focused on creating CMake configuration for libraries, executables and coverage.
- Added the configuration for libraries and executables
- Resolved parallel build problems with coverage configs
- Implemented generated source configurations
- To test the current progress, follow the instructions <a href="https://github.com/avinal/FOSSology/wiki#test-the-new-system-only-gcc-with-make-and-ninja-tested-for-now">here</a>


### Discussions

-   **Should I generalize the coverage build for each agent?**
    -   Coverage depends on the agent_tests and may or may not be available for all the agent. So follow the Makefiles and add the configuration as it is in them.
    -   Leave coverage for them who don\'t have it already in their Makefiles.
-   **What are `$(AGENTLIB) $(REPO) $(DB)` in the Makefiles?**
    -   They seems to be remains of previous build configuration. Until there is a problem, ignore if you can not find the definitions.
-   **Can I refactor the directory structure of nomos and monk, it will help keep the source code generation out of source directory?**
    -   Yeah, sure. As long as it does not affects the working of the project you may refactor them to suit your needs.
-   **I am facing problems with due to headers included using angled brackets, can I change them to double quotes instead?**
    -   Yeah that would be okay, anyway the general practice is to add user header files using double quotes.
-   **Using -Werror flag in regexscan causes build to fail, should I remove it?**
    -   Since `regexscan` is not the part of default build you can ignore it.
-   **In scheduler source code the preprocessor macro value for FOSSDB_CONF is different from that in lib, is that correct?**
    -   We have made some changes, please change it to the same as in lib.

### Conclusion and Further Plans

-   Try adding the version and commit hash info.
-   Implement writing version files for each build.
-   Add proper comments in the `CMakeLists.txt` files.
-   Complete the coverage build configuration
-   Start implementing the install configurations
