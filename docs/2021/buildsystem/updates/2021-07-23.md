## Meeting 10
*(July 23rd, 2021)*

This week I implemented CMake packaging configuration for FOSSology. There were two meetings in this week and this report covers both of them. 

### Attendees

-   [Michael C. Jaeger](https://github.com/mcjaeger)
-   [Shaheem Azmal M MD](https://github.com/shaheemazmalmmd)
-   [Gaurav Mishra](https://github.com/GMishx)
-   [Anupam Ghosh](https://github.com/ag4ums)
-   [Sarita Singh](https://github.com/itssingh)
-   [Avinal Kumar](https://github.com/avinal)

### Week 7 Progress

- Initial CMake packaging configuration implemented.
- Packages can be built according to the FOSSology previous packaging structure.
- Copyright, ecc and keyword now builds faster.
- To test the current progress, follow the instructions <a href="https://github.com/avinal/FOSSology/wiki#test-the-new-system-only-gcc-with-make-and-ninja-tested-for-now">here</a>


### Discussions

- **Where I can find packaging info for FOSSology?**
  
    - All the scripts and companion files are located inside `debian` folder.
    - The most important files are `control`, which contains the dependency and description of each package, and `rules` file, which contains the make commands for creating the packages.
    
- **What are** `${shlibs:Depends}` **and** `${misc:Depends}` ?

    - They are dependencies required for creating Debian packages. CMake should be adding them by default so we can safely ignore them.
    
- **Will the new packages have the same structure as the old ones?** *(Michael)*

    - Yes for compatibility purposes Gaurav has suggested exactly follow the same structure as the old one.
    
    
- **Copyright build is slow because the same object files are being compiled three times, can you improve that?** *(Gaurav)*
    
    - I can try compiling the common object files beforehand and then adding the executables. But how to know the common object files?
    - Gaurav showed me where in the Makefiles I can find the common object files.
    
    
- There are problems with copying the symbolic link and packaging them. So I have to find some alternatives to resolve that.
    
- With component installing, package description can no longer be set. 
- The `fossology-common` package contains file from `fossology-db` package. And the `fossology-db` package is empty.
    
    - Gaurav said this was unexpected and should not happen. This seems to be a very old bug with packaging.
    

### Conclusion and Further Plans

- Work more on the packaging.
- Improve compilation of copyright and monk agents
- Try to solve the packaging bug and add a pull request for that.
- Move on to implementing testing configurations.
