# Coding Week 7 Meeting

### Attendees

* Gaurav Mishra
* Vasudev 
* Ayush Bharadwaj
* Shreya Singh
* Kaushlendra Pratap Singh
* Omar AbdelSamea 

### Discussions

* Checking results manually and understanding the edge cases.
* Implementation of the edge cases like no ['DATE'] and only ['ORG'] or ['PERSON'] is present.
* Setting up the next target for the remaining weeks.
* Checking up the REGEX on the copyrights to check the validity of the code.
* Generating the Accuracy score for TP, FP, FN and TN.

### Week 7 Progress

* [Date] needed to be an important entity for copyright recognition but another check for no dates has been implemented to filter across wider results.
* Ran the algorithm over 100 thousand copyrights and the time period of 21 mints were scored.
* REGEX validity was checked and it can be used for future clutter removal maybe.
* Divided the datasets into chunks of 50 and 100 thousand to calculate wider expected results. 
* More reduction and updation to code was done by removing redundancy of (copyright copyright happening in the statements)
* The dataset also contains human errors and it is impacting our accuracy score for TP as well.
* Wiki has been Updated

### Conclusion and Further Plans

The filter of the copyrights needed to be more secured.
