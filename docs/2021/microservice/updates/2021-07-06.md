# Coding Week 5

## Meeting 0
### Organizer
- Gaurav Mishra

### Attendees
- Ayush Bharadwaj
- Vasudev Maduri
- Kaushlendra Singh
- Shreya Pratap
- Omar AbdelSamea

### Outcomes
- Presented a working method of using `kubectl exec` and tested with agents [ununpack, copyright, nomos]

## Spawning agents using `kubectl exec`
### Issues 
#### [copyright]: agent didn't send version information: "wrong command line arguments"
command: /etc/fossology/mods-enabled/copyright/agent/copyright --scheduler_start --userID=0 --groupID=0 --scheduler_start --jobId=0
- argument `--scheduler_start` is present twice found in meta_agent_init() 779 and agent_spawn 701
##### Solution
- removing `--scheduler_start` from agent_spawn() 701
#### [copyright]:  agent didn't send version information: "cannot open regex definitions in conf: /usr/local/share/fossology/copyright/agent/copyright.conf"
##### Solution
- adding --config /etc/fossology/mods-enabled to the command.
    - Didn't work If this argument is added it looks for fossology.conf not copyright.conf
'FATAL libfossscheduler.c.240: unable to open system configuration: unable to open configuration file "/etc/fossology/mods-enabled/fossology.conf"'
- create a soft link from /etc/fossology/mods-enabled/copyright/agent/copyright.conf  
to /usr/local/share/fossology/copyright/agent/copyright.conf
    - Worked
#### adj2nest debian package not found
- adj2nest is installed with ununpack package.
##### Solution
- creating adj2nest deployment with ununpack image.
#### [php7:error] [pid 19] [client 172.17.0.1:7237] PHP Fatal error:  Uncaught Exception: unsatisfied dependency 'agent_unpack'
- UI folder from agent is needed inside the web container otherwise it will not load it as a plugin.
##### Suggested solution
- bundling UI folders of all agents in the fossology-web package.

## End of the week results
- Solved presented issues of agent spawning.
- Applied some hacks to solve pending issues and proper solution will be provided later
  - for agents conf, Agents folders are copied into the container.
  - for web package missing UI folders, Agents folders are copied into the container.
