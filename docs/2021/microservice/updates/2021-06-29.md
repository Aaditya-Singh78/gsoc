# Coding Week 4

## Meeting 0
### Organizer
- Gaurav Mishra

### Attendees
- Omar AbdelSamea

### Outcomes
- Discussed the issue of meta-agents folder, currently, the scheduler looks for meta-agents in /etc/fossology/mods-enabled inside it's pod which doesn't contain any agent.
- As hot fix, Gaurav suggested implementing to mount mods-enabled folder to a PVC.
- To continue development until a final decision is taken from the mentors, all required agents will be copied to meta-agents folder inside the scheduler pod.

## Meeting 1
### Organizer
- Gaurav Mishra

### Attendees
- Ayush Bharadwaj
- Klaus Gmeinwieser
- Kaushlendra Singh
- Shreya Pratap
- Omar AbdelSamea

### Outcomes
- Presented how communication between the scheduler and agents will be implemented using `kubectl` exec instead of ssh.
- Tested it with fixed pod name and fixed commands and showed initial good results.

## Using `kubectl` instead of SSH
- As mentioned in this [thread](https://stackoverflow.com/q/49376513) using SSH between pods is not recommended.
### Using `kubectl` inside pod
- To use `kubectl` inside pod, special permissions needs to be granted fro this pod to be able to access the resources data inside the cluster. These permissions are granted using K8s [service account](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/configure-service-account/)
- Scheduler pod needs permissions so it can access pods and use exec command.
- Implemented service-account for scheduler is here https://github.com/OmarAbdelSamea/fossology/blob/OmarAbdelSamea/GSoC/Microservices/k8s/service-account-scheduler.yaml
### Issues
1- `error: error loading config file "/root/.kube/config": open /root/.kube/config: permission denied`
#### Description
- this issue occurs as .kube folder is created by default inside the root home directory and fossy folder doesn't have permissions to access this folder
#### Hot Fix
- add o+rwx permissions to /root/.kube permission
## End of the week results
- Initially implemented usage of `kubectl` instead of SSH on agent nomos with a fixed pod name and fixed command.
- Implemented multistage build for `fossology:packages` base image bringing it down from 2.1GB to 10MB.
- Implemented service-account for scheduler to grant needed permission to run `kubectl exec`.
