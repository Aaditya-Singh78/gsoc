### Outcomes
- Presented a possible implementation of migrating agent configuration to etcd.
- Discussed the issues that happened while trying to apply agent UI issue solution.

## Migrating agent configuration to etcd
- in the agent's entrypoint, [conf.sh](https://github.com/OmarAbdelSamea/fossology/blob/OmarAbdelSamea/GSoC/Microservices/Docker/conf.sh) will open agent conf file in `/usr/share/fossology/<agent_name>/<agent_name>.conf` and start iterating over it and extracts agent conf then create a PUT request to etcd pod for each configuration.
- To reload the scheduler configuration `fo_cli` will be used using `--reload` option.

## End of the week result 
- Migrated Agent configuraiton from `<agent_name>.conf` to etcd 
  - [scheduler_agent_config](https://github.com/OmarAbdelSamea/fossology/blob/OmarAbdelSamea/GSoC/Microservices/src/scheduler/agent/scheduler.c#L795)
- created conf.sh to iterate over agent configuration and make the appropriate API calls to etcd container.
- Added fo_cli and modified entrypoint to reload scheduler configuration.
- Applied discussed solution of bundling UI folders inside web package.
