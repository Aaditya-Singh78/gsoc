# Coding Week 3

## Meeting 0
### Organizer
- Gaurav Mishra

### Attendees
- Omar AbdelSamea

### Outcomes
- Traced source code to see how the scheduler should be modified to accept single agent on each host.
- we found that:
 - function [agent_test](https://github.com/OmarAbdelSamea/fossology/blob/master/src/scheduler/agent/agent.c#L249) should be modified to only test the agent found inside the host
 - to get the agent type inside the host a new parameter should be added in fossology.conf 

## Meeting 1
### Organizer
- Gaurav Mishra

### Attendees
- Anupam Ghosh
- Ayush Bharadwaj
- Vasudev Maduri
- Kaushlendra Singh
- Shreya Pratap
- Omar AbdelSamea

### Outcomes
- Presented some enhancement on adding a single service for all agents.
- Discussed the Scheduler Host problem and how it could be implemented in the next week.

## End of the week results
- Implemented headless services instead of ClusterIP for each agent.
- Used headless service for scheduler instead of ClusterIP.
- Used ClusterIP with database instead of NodePort as the database doesn't need to be exposed.
- Added Config Maps and Secrets for database.
- Fixed a bug in Dockerfiles (debian package version was hardcoded, solution was replacing version with *)
- Enhanced scheduler Dockerfile, instead of installing web.deb to get chore-schema.dat just copied it from source code.
- Used stateful set with database instead of deployment.
