## Meeting 1
### Organizer
- Gaurav Mishra

### Attendees
- Anupam Ghosh
- Ayush Bharadwaj
- Vasudev Maduri
- Kaushlendra Singh
- Shreya Pratap
- Omar AbdelSamea

### Outcomes 
- Discussed the issues while trying to setup Docker-compse.
- Discussed a possible implementation of communication between the scheduler and agents.

## Creating network using docker-compose
### Issues
1- While trying to connect the scheduler container with db container using docker-compose. the `docker-entrypoint` have `fo-postinstall` inside it to install FOSSology db schema inside the db container, but `core-schema.dat` wasn't found inside the scheduler container.
#### Solution 
- `core-schema.dat` is found inside `fossology-web.deb` hence this package is installed inside the scheduler container. Better solution will be provided in the future as the required file `core-schema.dat` could be copied to the container in the Dockerfile.

2- nomos container exits immediately and it returns **status code 0**. `exec /usr/sbin/sshd -D` and `exec /bin/bash` both added to the `docker-entrypoint` to keep the container running but it didn't work.



## End of the week results
- Created a separate container for PostgreSQL database
- Solved the issues between the scheduler and database, checked all missing dependencies for correct starting of all containers and configured the `docker-entrypoint.sh` to work with all the separate containers
- Started a network using docker-compose with the new Dockerfiles between scheduler, UI and database.
- Started the initial implemntation of K8s cluster.
