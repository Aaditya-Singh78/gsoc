* Added the edit Uploads page. Created the getFolders page from where it is fetching all the folders. Created the organizeUploads which contains deleteUploadFile and getUploadsById.
* Replaced the getFolders Api function with the common function in editUploads.
* Updated the alerts styling to snackbars. Closes issue [#67](https://github.com/fossology/FOSSologyUI/issues/67).
* Added the vcs upload page.
* Added the recursive request for the request of `/uploads/{id}`, retries is set to be for 10 now.
* Created the issue for single request for the upload and analysis as discussed in the meeting with which user don't have to wait for the analysis process.
* Currently, we are not having REST API for edit the uploads, we need to expose the edit upload from api, so created the issue for it.
* Remove the redundancy of credentials in the api by setting initial value of credentials to include.
* Added the one-shot license analysis page and all the related states to it.
* Added the one-shot copyright/email/url page and all the related states to it.
* Added the one-shot monk page and all the related states to it.
* Created the issue for Access-Control-Expose-Headers response header indicates which headers can be exposed as part of the response by listing their names.
* Added the list of all Access control headers and Expose headers used in the fossology.
* Added the pagination feature in browse page.
* Added the entries field and pagination just like the current implementation.
* Stored the response header of x-total-pages in localStorage.
