- Added the edit Uploads page. Created the getFolders page from where it is fetching all the folders. Created the organizeUploads which contains deleteUploadFile and getUploadsById.
- Replaced the getFolders Api function with the common function in editUploads.
- Updated the alerts styling to snackbars. Closes issue [#67](https://github.com/fossology/FOSSologyUI/issues/67).

- Added the recursive request for the request of `/uploads/{id}`, retries is set to be for 10 now.
- Created the issue for single request for the upload and analysis as discussed in the meeting with which user don't have to wait for the analysis process.

- Added the one-shot license analysis page and all the related states to it.
- Added the one-shot copyright/email/url page and all the related states to it.
