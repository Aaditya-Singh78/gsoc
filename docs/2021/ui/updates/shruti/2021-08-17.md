* Moved the scheduleAnalysis route in jobs object.
* Shifted the scheduleAnalysis function in `api/jobs` and `services/jobs`.
* Fixed all the uploads such as vcs, url and file and scheduleAgents in jobs.
* Fixed the footer text alignment.
* Fixed the browse headings size.
* Made the header sticky on the top when we scroll down the page.
* Added the license browser page.
* Added the api endpoints for summary and license of the uploads.
* Integrated the api for uploads summary and upload license api.
* Since, upload license api has problem of pagination, improper file paths, and it also requires the agent as a header which currently no api is returning, so hard coded the agents for the time being i.e `ojo`, `nomos` and `monk`.
* The font inside textareas are weirdly bold and their sizes are inconsistent at different places, so fixed the textareas in all the pages.
* Fixed the text-area of license text to monospace font because maximum licenses are optimized for text files of fixed width and thus formatted like that.
* Hide the Snackbar after couple of seconds which improves the user experience.
* Added the conditions on search headers.
    * Created the variables for pageParam, pageLimt.
    * Added the conditions on pages, limit and totalPages.
* Added the `updatedUpload` function in `UpdateController.php`.
* Added the patch request for `/uploads`.
* Added the function call in `RestAuthMiddleware.php`
* Updated the `openapi.yaml` with upload patch request.
* Added the detailed explanation of [folder structure](https://github.com/fossology/FOSSologyUI/wiki/Folder-Structure).
