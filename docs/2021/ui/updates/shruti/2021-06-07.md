* Created wireframes of different colour schemes.

* Finalized the wireframes.
* Decided the libraries to be used.
* Finalized the architecture of the codebase.
* Created a pull request for the basic folder structure.

## Explanation
Web application architecture defines the interactions between applications, middleware systems, and databases to ensure multiple applications can work together.

### Wireframes
Every project starts with a clear vision. Hence our first step was to  design the user interface, taking reference from modern web apps.
A good interface design should be attractive. It means that the use of that interface is enjoyable. The design should include cool user-friendly features with visual appeal. Clarity is the most important characteristic of our user interface design.
We have prepared many prototypes and low as well as high fidelity wireframes for FOSSology.
