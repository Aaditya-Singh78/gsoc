- Blank screen is coming on [https://fossology.github.io/FOSSologyUI/](https://fossology.github.io/FOSSologyUI/), added the public url to the `deploy.yml`.
- Created the `.env` file from `.env.sample` for the deployment.
- Added the route basename so that later it can also serve on `localhost/react`.
- Added the auth variables needed for login mechanism in env.
- Fixed the invalid errors in all the pages, due to airbnb style we have converted the error message to new Error class and which was giving invalid errors on the bad requests.

    - Added the secondary colour to the theme.js for the darker shade of active element.
    - Added the styling in the globalStyle.js for the hover, focus and dropdown.
    - Added the location for the paths in header component.
- Added the `import-parse` property in .eslintrc to resolve the parsing errors.
- Fixed the groups api function by removing credentials which is defined in sendRequest.
- Vcs page was getting broken on making the request.  Closes [#111](https://github.com/fossology/FOSSologyUI/issues/111).
    - Changed the promise rejection parameter.
    - Changd the retries left property in sendrequest.
    - Returned the function if retries are greater than 0.
