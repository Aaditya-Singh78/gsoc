- [Michael C. Jaeger](https://github.com/mcjaeger)
- [Gaurav Mishra ](https://github.com/GMishx)
- [Avinal Kumar ](https://github.com/avinal)
- [Sarita Singh ](https://github.com/itssingh)


### Week 5.1 Progress

- Added ScanCodeFindings table in Copyright Browser on UI.
- Working on populating this table with scancode_copyright data.

### Discussions

### Integrating scancode UI with copyright UI 

- Copyright UI could be modified to integrate Scancode_Copyright and Scancode_Author UI.
- CopyrightDao could be modified to include scancode copyright and author data too, no need to create a separate file for scancodeDao.
- Users Findings are independent of any agent so no agentID has to be update in the copyright UI code for scancode but we have to take care for the type.
- Gaurav suggested to use different type for copyright statement from what is used by copyright agent. Scancode will be using `scancode_statement`  for copyright type and `statement` is used by copyright agent.
- Two new tables named `scancode_copyright_event` , and `scancode_author_event`  are required to store Deactivated ScanCode findings statements and Deactivated Author statements respectively.
- To generate report copyright agent is hard coded at several places, figure out some way to add scancode data also.

### Discussion regarding Documentation

- Gaurav gave [this](https://github.com/fossology/fossology/pull/2040/files#diff-8e7c89ac20d0fcd6aa91a097accabecfdebf47343da0d71fbb4edc8527309c00) as a reference to add copyright in the project code files.
- Michael suggested to look into [coding guidelines](https://github.com/fossology/fossology/wiki/Coding-Style#default-license-and-file-headers) for default license for the project code files.
- Micheal suggested prepare a document for fossology wiki section like other agents have.
- Gaurav in the last GSoC meeting suggested to document the working of scancode agent for first evaluation and adding comments to the code written till now.  

### Conclusion and Further Plans

- Documentation for scancode project in my project [wiki](https://github.com/itssingh/fossology/wiki) .
- Refactor code written till now.
- Populating scancode copyright UI table.
