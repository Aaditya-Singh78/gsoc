- [Ayush Bhardwaj ](https://github.com/hastagAB)
- [Avinal Kumar ](https://github.com/avinal)

### Current Progress

- Learnt PHP, SQL database.
- Lerning API on which Gaurav has suggested to leave it for now.
- Working on a project using PHP, SQL, Twig template, should be completed before the next meet.

### Discussions
- Gaurav suggested to make GSoC timeline accessible to everyone and prepare a meeting report for others.
- About the wrapper
    - I found the [Ninka wrapper](https://github.com/itssingh/fossology/tree/master/src/ninka) to be the suitable match for scancode plugin for FOSSology:
        - useful functions for license integration are available so some changes or addition should work.
        - I have already used this wrapper to create a [prototype](https://github.com/itssingh/scanology).
        - Mentors approved to use the wrapper used for Ninka.
- About spdx key dispute
    -A NOMOS and ScanCode scan output [comparison list](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1lgAVHofEXyVLa7ocrl8rGjuNulY7VgF-WGOQVqYkmoE/edit#gid=680720653).
    - same licenses with slight variation in spdx key ex. LGPL-2.1-or-later (scancode) and LGPL-2.1+ (NOMOS) will be taken care as [ojo agent](https://github.com/fossology/fossology/blob/master/src/ojo/agent/OjosDatabaseHandler.cc) does.
    - Write a regex to make license keys case insensitive ex. inner-net-2.0 (scancode) and InnerNet-2.00 (NOMOS).
    - Add new license to the license database table.
- About the Project Proposal
    - Gaurav said everything looks fine in the proposal except the UI part. Ninka wrapper UI could work for license integration. copyright and email will required changes.
    - Once license integration will be completed, have to see for parallel processing supported by scancode to optimize the speed.

### Conclusion and Further Plans
- Ninka Wrapper finalised.
- Spdx key dispute solve like ojo.
- Create scancode Jinja template.
- Add new scan output to wrapper.
- Fork and create a branch for development and mention the same in blog/wiki.
- Add a timeline section in blog/wiki as provided in the project proposal.
- Prepare a prototype/plan for the next week.



## Coding Week 0.2 Meeting
`Date:2021-06-04`

### Attendees

- [Gaurav Mishra ](https://github.com/GMishx)
- [Anupam Ghosh ](https://github.com/ag4ums)
- [Avinal Kumar ](https://github.com/avinal)
- [Sarita Singh ](https://github.com/itssingh)

### Week 0.1 Progress

- ScanCode [custom output](https://gist.github.com/itssingh/93db537d2a9c9a6780a71cd84a41c6ab) for license, copyright and holders is working.
- Currently scancode doesn't support emails and urls custom output.
- Opened a pr for [this](https://github.com/nexB/scancode-toolkit/pull/2539)

### Discussions

- About the DatabaseHandler
    - Gaurav explained how [ojos databasehandler](https://github.com/fossology/fossology/blob/master/src/ojo/agent/OjosDatabaseHandler.cc) workes.
    - Convert shortname to lower-case.
    - Remove last occurrence of + and -or-later.
    - Remove last occurrence of -only.
    - Similar approach can work for license spdx key [differnece](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1lgAVHofEXyVLa7ocrl8rGjuNulY7VgF-WGOQVqYkmoE/edit#gid=680720653) in scancode and fossology database.
- About the UI
    - ScanCode simple UI (License integration) will resemble more with ojo.
    - When it will be parametrized( copyrights, emails, urls along with license), It will resemble closely with decider UI.
    - When scancode UI will have licenses, coyright, email, urls options then user can select more than one options at once.
    write a plugin containg a switch case will give execute based on the options selected. Decider uses [this](https://github.com/fossology/fossology/blob/master/src/decider/ui/DeciderAgentPlugin.php#L75-L126).

### Conclusion and Further Plans

- Scancode Jinja template is working for license and copyright.
- Start working on scancode integration for license scanning.
- There would be a meet at May 7, 2021.
- Fork and create a branch for development and mention the same in blog/wiki [done](https://github.com/itssingh/fossology/wiki).
- Add a timeline section in blog/wiki as provided in the project proposal [done](https://itssingh.github.io/gsoc-blog/timeline.html).
