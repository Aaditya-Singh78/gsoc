## Coding Week 5 Meeting 1
`Date:2021-07-06`

### Attendees 

- [Michael C. Jaeger](https://github.com/mcjaeger)
- [Gaurav Mishra ](https://github.com/GMishx)
- [Avinal Kumar ](https://github.com/avinal)
- [Sarita Singh ](https://github.com/itssingh)

### Week 4.3 Progress

- Created `UI Wireframes` with `Figma` for ScanCode copyright and author.

### Discussions 

- The first idea is to have a `separate browser` for ScanCode agent [link](https://www.figma.com/file/Kj3DQlhNXkZkq6DgpdfXFt/Untitled?node-id=0%3A1).
    - Michael suggested not to use these as *ScanCode-Toolkit project is recognized mainly for it's license scanning* now keeping only Copyright and Author information in this section whereas licenses in another section will be confusing for users.
    - Gaurav also didn't approve this idea.
- The second idea is to *reuse existing Copyright and Email/URL/Author browser* [link](https://www.figma.com/file/Kj3DQlhNXkZkq6DgpdfXFt/Untitled?node-id=12%3A8).
    - *Reusing copyright and Email/URL/Author browser section seems to be nice idea*.
    - Michael didn't find navigation between ScanCode agent and FOSSology Copyright agent using drop-down a good options. It seems to be lost. So instead of drop-down using tabs would looks nice.
    - No need to repeat users finding for ScanCode agent as user is not interested in providing decision for a particular agent but instead they do for a file. 
- Michael proposed following idea instead

    ![image](/img/scancode/author_browser.png)

    - It reuses Copyright and Author browser space.
    - There is no redundant user decision for copyright agent.
    - Looks nice to all the attendees.

- Discussion regarding how to display scanner findings in the Copyright/Email/Url/Author clearing section for a file.
    - Michael, Avinal and Sarita disused to add a column named source in the scanner finding table like license table in the clearing section. 
    - Under this source column two keyword could be use one `S` for ScanCode findings and `F` for FOSSology Copyright agent findings.
    - Gaurav suggested not to use this idea because for the same copyright statement, Fossology and ScanCode can have different scan result.
    - In case of license, there is `License_ref table` which provides same license name for all the different agents for a license do no mismatching is there.
    - Doing same for Copyright will require lot of time.
 
- Gaurav Suggested two ideas for the same
    - There can be two tabs to switch between ScanCode Findings and FOSSology Copyright Findings.
    - Second idea is to ask user about a default agent out of FOSSology copyright and ScanCode for an upload and display copyright/email/url/author result by the default agent.
- Gaurav would like to discuss further in the next meeting.

### Conclusion and Further Plans

- Implement Micheal's proposed idea for copyright browser and Email/URL/Author Browser.
- Take feedback from other mentors too.
