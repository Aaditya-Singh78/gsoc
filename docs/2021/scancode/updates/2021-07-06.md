## Coding Week 5 Meeting 1
`Date:2021-07-06`

### Attendees 

- [Michael C. Jaeger](https://github.com/mcjaeger)
- [Gaurav Mishra ](https://github.com/GMishx)
- [Avinal Kumar ](https://github.com/avinal)
- [Sarita Singh ](https://github.com/itssingh)

### Week 4 Progress

- Created `scancode_copyright` and `scancode_author` table in the FOSSology database.
- Copyright and author information coming from scancode scan result is inserted in these newly created tables.
- Improved license data insertion in the `license_file` and `highlight` tables by inserting only unique entries based upon `rf_fk`, `agent_fk`, and `pfile_fk`. It solved UI glitch in license relevant text highlighting for scancode.
- Latest [commit](https://github.com/itssingh/fossology/commit/c823ecf7a5d59fbfe243281c41598ea161e04435) having code to create tables.
- Created `UI Wireframes` with `Figma` for ScanCode copyright and author.

### Discussions 

- The first idea is to have a `separate browser` for ScanCode agent [link](https://www.figma.com/file/Kj3DQlhNXkZkq6DgpdfXFt/Untitled?node-id=0%3A1).
    - Michael suggested not to use these as *ScanCode-Toolkit project is recognized mainly for it's license scanning* now keeping only Copyright and Author information in this section whereas licenses in another section will be confusing for users.
    - Gaurav also didn't approve this idea.
- The second idea is to *reuse existing Copyright and Email/URL/Author browser* [link](https://www.figma.com/file/Kj3DQlhNXkZkq6DgpdfXFt/Untitled?node-id=12%3A8).
    - *Reusing copyright and Email/URL/Author browser section seems to be nice idea*.
    - Michael didn't find navigation between ScanCode agent and FOSSology Copyright agent using drop-down a good options. It seems to be lost. So instead of drop-down using tabs would looks nice.
    - No need to repeat users finding for ScanCode agent as user is not interested in providing decision for a particular agent but instead they do for a file. 
- Michael proposed following idea instead

    ![image](/img/scancode/copyright_browser.png)
    ![image](/img/scancode/author_browser.png)

    - It reuses Copyright and Author browser space.
    - There is no redundant user decision for copyright agent.
    - Looks nice to all the attendees.

- Discussion regarding how to display scanner findings in the Copyright/Email/Url/Author clearing section for a file.
    - Michael, Avinal and Sarita disused to add a column named source in the scanner finding table like license table in the clearing section. 
    - Under this source column two keyword could be use one `S` for ScanCode findings and `F` for FOSSology Copyright agent findings.
    - Gaurav suggested not to use this idea because for the same copyright statement, Fossology and ScanCode can have different scan result.
    - In case of license, there is `License_ref table` which provides same license name for all the different agents for a license do no mismatching is there.
    - Doing same for Copyright will require lot of time.
 
- Gaurav Suggested two ideas for the same
    - There can be two tabs to switch between ScanCode Findings and FOSSology Copyright Findings.
    - Second idea is to ask user about a default agent out of FOSSology copyright and ScanCode for an upload and display copyright/email/url/author result by the default agent.
- Gaurav would like to discuss further in the next meeting.

### Conclusion and Further Plans

- Implement Micheal's proposed idea for copyright browser and Email/URL/Author Browser.
- Take feedback from other mentors too. 

## Coding Week 5 Meeting 2

### Discussions

### Integrating scancode UI with copyright UI 

- Copyright UI could be modified to integrate Scancode_Copyright and Scancode_Author UI.
- CopyrightDao could be modified to include scancode copyright and author data too, no need to create a separate file for scancodeDao.
- Users Findings are independent of any agent so no agentID has to be update in the copyright UI code for scancode but we have to take care for the type.
- Gaurav suggested to use different type for copyright statement from what is used by copyright agent. Scancode will be using `scancode_statement`  for copyright type and `statement` is used by copyright agent.
- Two new tables named `scancode_copyright_event` , and `scancode_author_event`  are required to store Deactivated ScanCode findings statements and Deactivated Author statements respectively.
- To generate report copyright agent is hard coded at several places, figure out some way to add scancode data also.

### Discussion regarding Documentation

- Gaurav gave [this](https://github.com/fossology/fossology/pull/2040/files#diff-8e7c89ac20d0fcd6aa91a097accabecfdebf47343da0d71fbb4edc8527309c00) as a reference to add copyright in the project code files.
- Michael suggested to look into [coding guidelines](https://github.com/fossology/fossology/wiki/Coding-Style#default-license-and-file-headers) for default license for the project code files.
- Micheal suggested prepare a document for fossology wiki section like other agents have.
- Gaurav in the last GSoC meeting suggested to document the working of scancode agent for first evaluation and adding comments to the code written till now.  

### Conclusion and Further Plans

- Documentation for scancode project in my project [wiki](https://github.com/itssingh/fossology/wiki) .
- Refactor code written till now.
- Populating scancode copyright UI table.
