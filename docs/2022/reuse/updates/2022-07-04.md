- Issue [#1513](https://github.com/fossology/fossology/issues/1513)
    - We discussed approach for `Support the SPDX-FileCopyrightText keyword in the copyright agent`.
    - To correctly identify SPDX-FileCopyrightText, regex needs to be improved.
    - Reso agent will copy the findings of Copyright agent from the `.license` file to the associated file.
    - To make testing easier, mentors taught the CLI method.
- REUSE copyright and licensing standard Implementation
    - Current REUSE status
        - When running reuse lint, the result is as follows:
        ```
        Files with copyright information: 4152 / 4360
        Files with license information: 3723 / 4360
        ```
    - Mentors reviewed pull request [#2248](https://github.com/fossology/fossology/pull/2248) and suggested few changes.
    - Discussed the issue of bad licenses/missing licenses coming from testdata files in resue tool. Mentors suggested to raise a issue in reuse github repository.
    - Few doubts were cleared regarding the comment formatting of the files.

### Discussions/Updates

- Implemented REUSE standard in more files.
- Learned about regular expressions.
- During the implementation of the REUSE.software standard, I added the license and copyright information to testdata files through dep5. However, reuse tool still shows missing/bad licensing information from testdata files. I have added an [issue](https://github.com/fsfe/reuse-tool/issues/556) to fsfe/reuse-tool for the solution to this.

### Conclusion and Further Plans

- I will implement REUSE copyright and licensing information on more files
- We will discuss a solution to the issue of testdata file at our next project meeting.
- I will work on the SPDX-FileCopyrightText keyword in the copyright agent this week.
