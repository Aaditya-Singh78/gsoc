## Meeting 12
*(July 12th, 2022)*

GSoC 2022 Project Discussions - REUSE

### Attendees

- [Gaurav Mishra](https://github.com/GMishx)
- [Shaheem Azmal M MD](https://github.com/shaheemazmalmmd)
- [Rohit Pandey](https://github.com/rohitpandey49)

### Discussions/Updates

- Implemented REUSE standard in more files.
    - Current REUSE status - when running reuse lint, the result is as follows:
        ```
        Files with copyright information: 4322 / 4364
        Files with license information: 4284 / 4364
        ```
- In the issue I raised in fsfe/reuse-tool, I received two following suggestions/solutions:
    - Put a .license file next to your testdata files. The contents of the testdata files will be ignored, and the contents of the .license file will be used instead.
    - Put REUSE-IgnoreStart and REUSE-IgnoreEnd in your testdata files. Documentation [Link](https://reuse.readthedocs.io/en/stable/usage.html#ignoring-parts-of-a-file).
- Discussed both solutions with mentors and decided to use the second solution i.e. `REUSE-IgnoreStart` and `REUSE-IgnoreEnd` in your testdata files.
- Mentors provided guidance on how to correctly identify SPDX-FileCopyrightText.
- Few doubts cleared regarding the comment formatting of the multiple files.
