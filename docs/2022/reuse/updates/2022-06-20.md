### Discussions/Updates

- Resolved all the comments/feedbacks added my mentors in [#2235](https://github.com/fossology/fossology/pull/2235).
- Mentors reviewed all the changes and found correct.
- Current REUSE status
    - When running reuse lint, the result is as follows:
        ```
        Files with copyright information: 2619 / 4360
        Files with license information: 1066 / 4360
        ```
- We discussed adding copyright to files without copyright information to make code fully reuse compliant. We finalized the copyright statement for such files - `SPDX-FileCopyrightText: Â© Fossology contributors`.
- Few doubts were cleared regarding the comment formatting of the `.sql` and `VERSION` files.

### Conclusion and Further Plans

- Implement discussed solution in upcoming week.
