- Notes after discussion:
    - Every file in the LICENSES folder will automatically be considered a Declared License once it has been cleared.
    - The feature can be [de]activated via a new option on the Conf page (for each Upload); Feature will be activated by default for all new Uploads.
    - Add a new table in the Summary section of the Upload.
