## Adopting REUSE standards in FOSSology
Copyright and licensing is difficult, especially when reusing software from
different projects that are released under various different licenses. REUSE
make it easier for us to declare the licenses under which our works are
released, but they also make it easier for a computer to understand how your
project is licensed. FOSSology currently uses old methods of defining licenses
on source files. Following the REUSE specs, the code base of FOSSology should
be updated with new licensing format.
