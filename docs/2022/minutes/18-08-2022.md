  - In the past week I have been following your database sessions and trying to understand the database of the fossology more. I was working on all the raised PRs and updated them with the changes requested by the respective mentors. I was also working on a method to display the clearing decision on the UI itself. Will raise a PR for this as soon as the PR for the backend is merged. In addition to that I was able to plan out a way to return the number of decisions to be cleared for each file name and will try to implement them soon. Also I am currently lagging behind in the gsoc docs section which I plan to clear it out asap.
