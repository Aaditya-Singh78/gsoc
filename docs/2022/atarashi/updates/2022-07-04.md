### Discussions

- Created the python packages for both **[LogisticRegression](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.linear_model.LogisticRegression.html)** and **[Linear SVC](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.svm.LinearSVC.html)**
  model. Below is the file structure for created package:

```
                  +-- linearsvc
                  │   +-- LICENSE
                  │   +-- MANIFEST.in
                  │   +-- README.md
                  │   +-- setup.py
                  │   +-- src
                  │       +-- linearsvc
                  │       │   +-- data
                  │       │   │   +-- linearsvc
                  │       │   +-- __init__.py
                  │       +-- model_train.py
                  +-- logreg
                      +-- LICENSE
                      +-- MANIFEST.in
                      +-- README.md
                      +-- setup.py
                      +-- src
                          +-- logreg
                          │   +-- data
                          │   │   +-- logreg
                          │   +-- __init__.py
                          +-- model_train.py
```

- Modified **init.py** from the **src** folder of both the python packages as suggested:

  - In the code below, it can be seen that the linearsvc class have two functions:
    1. **linearsvc.classify()** can be called to get the model classifier and the classifier can
       be further used to predict the license shortname for **[atarshi](https://github.com/fossology/atarashi)**
       agent just by using the **[predict()](https://www.askpython.com/python/examples/python-predict-function)**
       function.
    2. And in **linearsvc.predict_shortname()**, we can directly pass the preprocessed file and it will
       return the license shortname.
  - Similar functions has been implemented for **logreg** model also.

```python
            class linearsvc():
              def __init__(self, preprocessed_file):
                  self.preprocessed_file = preprocessed_file

              def classify(self):
                  data = resource_filename("linearsvc", "data/linearsvc")
                  with open(data, 'rb') as f:
                      Classifier = pickle.load(f)
                  return Classifier

              def predict_shortname(self):
                  predictor = self.classify()
                  return predictor.predict(self.preprocessed_file)
```

- Implemented the agent for **[Linear SVC](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.svm.LinearSVC.html)**
  on **[atarshi](https://github.com/fossology/atarashi)** locally.

### Conclusion and Further Plans

- Will make the changes according to further suggestion.
- Will start implementing **[okapi_BM25](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Okapi_BM25)** in place of
  **[tfidftransformer](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.feature_extraction.text.TfidfTransformer.html)**
  for ranking the license text on dataset for training the models and compare which among the two is working better
  on dataset.
