### Updates

- Created a report of my project for final evaluation. Report can be seen [here](https://github.com/its-sushant/GSoC-22)
- Traning of [Doc2vec Model](https://radimrehurek.com/gensim/models/doc2vec.html) is on hold for now because the model
  is taking too long to train.
- Started learning transformers for implementing it on [minerva dataset](https://github.com/fossology/Minerva-Dataset-Generation)

### Conclusion and Further Plans

- As the main part of my project is completed and currently I am working on some optional part of the project, will
  work accordingly as per the suggestions from mentors.
