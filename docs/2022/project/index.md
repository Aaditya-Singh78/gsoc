## Introduce concept of project in FOSSology
I would like to participate in the project “Introduce concept of project in
FOSSology” which can be founded in the idea list. The “project” is defined by:
1. a project ID (as primary key)
2. a project name
3. a root folder in Fossology
4. one or more Group IDs and associated access.
5. a URL / ID / Free field to link the project to an external tool

The “project” concept is put by Nicolas Toussaint in the issue
[#1738](https://github.com/fossology/fossology/issues/1738). As described, it
could be useful in many ways, such as gathering multiple uploads under the same
umbrella, and making bulk changes to all uploads / sub-directories that belong
to a given project. This project is like a web project. I need to modify both
back-end logic and front-end pages. And the product of this project will be a
new-version website that could support the operations on “project” level.
