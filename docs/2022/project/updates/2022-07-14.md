### Discussions

I have created Project Add, Project Delete and Project Edit pages. However, this pages are static and couln't provide their function now because most of their codes are just copy from the folder pages. However, for now I can show what I will do for other GSOC members. Mentors give me some advices for next steps (where the code is and how to begin)

### Conclusion and Further Plans

- Created some new pages but not completely work
- In next week, I will try to make the pages dynamic and able to provide their functions.
