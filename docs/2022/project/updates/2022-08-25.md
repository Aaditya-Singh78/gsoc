## Meeting 13
*(August 25th, 2022)*

<!--truncate-->

### Attendees

There is no attendees list available.

### Discussions
I have implemeted the function of BrowseProject.
Also, I have fixed the error in project deletion. For now, the whole progress of project - create, edit, upload and delete has worked.

### Conclusion and Further Plans

- Since the project manage function has been finished. I will try to add a new report generation method to Fossology. In special, when user generates report in a folder view, the report will show every upload's license one by one. However, when user generates report in a project view, the report will just show every license existing in the project once. 
- Before implementing the report part, I will try to push my codes about project manage to my github repo and let the mentors check it.
