## Meeting 11
*(August 11st, 2022)*

<!--truncate-->

### Attendees

There is no attendees list available.

### Discussions

I implement the function of upload a file to a project. To do that, I write a new ProjectDao and modify the database structure. The content stored in project and  projectcontent table is still with some bug. I will fixed it next week.
Mentors points some misunderstanding of my implement. They also advises me to do project create and delete function as my next step.

### Conclusion and Further Plans

- I will first fix the bug in upload function. Then I will try to implement the functions of project add, delete and edit.
