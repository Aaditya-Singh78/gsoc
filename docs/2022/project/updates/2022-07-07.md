### Discussions

I have created the BrowseProject page. However, I don't know how to add a menu item with 2 sub items but no content. So there are 3 pages now. Browse(the same code with BrowseFolder), BrowseFolder and BrowseProject. Mentors tell me there could be some problems and I could turn to next part for now.

### Conclusion and Further Plans

- Add a BrowseProject page
- In next week, I will study the code about how to manage a folder, and try to use them for project.
