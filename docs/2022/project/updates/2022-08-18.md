## Meeting 12
*(August 18th, 2022)*

<!--truncate-->

### Attendees

There is no attendees list available.

### Discussions

I implemented the functions of project add, delete and edit. However, the function of project delete couldn't delete the records in database in fact. Mentors tell me it may be because of the delagent and I am better to put this topic later. 

### Conclusion and Further Plans

- I will try to implemnt the function of Browse in project view in next week.
