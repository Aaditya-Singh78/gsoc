## Meeting 10
*(August 4th, 2022)*

<!--truncate-->

### Attendees

There is no attendees list available.

### Discussions

I am still studying the code about uploading a file to a folder. It is a little complicated.
Mentors give me much encouragement. They share me the article of how to use XDebug to debug php project. They also answer my many questions to help me boost my work.

### Conclusion and Further Plans

- I will still try to implement the function of upload a file to a certain project in the next week.
