## Meeting 15
*(September 8th, 2022)*

<!--truncate-->

### Attendees

There is no attendees list available.

### Discussions
I modify the generation button in the browse page, make it transform a new paramater "type" to show the request is from folder browse page or project browse page. I also modify the readmeoss agent to make it could get the value of this paramater.
However, I fail to generate a correct report using my test data. In the discussion, mentors show me the correct way to scan license of uploads and generate report. They also answered many questions I have met during the last week.

### Conclusion and Further Plans

- I will fix my bugs in code and continue to implemnt the new report generation function.
