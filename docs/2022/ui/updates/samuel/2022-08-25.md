## THIS WEEK'S CONTRIBUTIONS 

###  FRONTEND

- Made the improvements on the FOSSOlogy Maintenance page:
I fixed the issue with the existing test cases that were causing the CI/CDs for the fossology maintenance page to fail deploying.

###  BACKEND 

- Added an API to delete **Admin License Candidate**:
With the given Id of the license Candidate in the request parameters, i can delete the  license.

**How it works:**

####  FIRST CASE
   In this case, the Admin-license-candidate exists, and the license-candidate will be deleted successfully.

#### SECOND CASE
In this case, the Admin-license-candidate doesn't exist, so 404 error will be returned instead.

#### THIRD CASE

The request is not coming from the Admin.
This request can only be run by the admin , else the request will fail returning 400 ERROR.

- I will continue working on the APIs that are not available on the license module.
- I will also work on the UI of the license module.
- I will also continue to improve the UI of the FOSSOlogy maintenance page.
