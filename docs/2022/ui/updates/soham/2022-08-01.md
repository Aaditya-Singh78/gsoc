## Jobs/all endpoint added

_(August 14th, 2022)_

Working on the `uploads/<uploadID>/licenses` endpoint to return the latest clearing decision for each and every filepath.

Was able to return the latest clearing status for each upload ID and return it in the api response:

### PR link - [feat(api): clearing status](https://github.com/fossology/fossology/pull/2288)

## License browser page updated

Worked on the License Browser page and formatted the scanner results and the edited results response. Also modified to remove the limit on the page to view all the responses.<br/>
Current status of the License browser page:

### PR link - [fix(licenses): header fixed and limit for responses removed](https://github.com/fossology/FOSSologyUI/pull/246)

### Conclusion and Further Plans

- Implementing the clearing decisions response on the UI.
- Implementing the number of `decisions to be cleared / open / total` response for the licenses endpoint.
- Exploring and learing more about the database structure of the fossology project and implement the concepts to develop more API endpoints in the future.
