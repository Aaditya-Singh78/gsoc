## API Implemention of Add and Edit user page

- This task included
  - Changing the initial design in which the mock API handling was done.
  - Create `services` and `api modules` for the user API's.
  - Implement the REST APIs in the UI and test everything.
  - Changing the flow of creating a REST Token (Now the user need to put in his password to create a custom REST API token)
  - Handle any unexpected UI behaviour due to change in the expected API response.
- Following are the APIs implemented
  - `POST /users` to create a user.
  - `PUT /users/{id}` to modify user details.
  - `POST /users/tokens` to create a REST API Token.
  - `GET /users/tokens/{type}` to get all the REST API tokens available.

## New APIs

## `Show Jobs` API

As per requirement `Show Jobs` page needs to be implemented in the UI. There was no existing API that provided all the required details for the same.

### Overview

- I implemented the show jobs API and it will be available at `GET /uploads/{id}/history`, where `{id}` is the upload id.
- I'll be issuing a PR for this once I design the API docs in `openapi.yaml`.

## Conclusions and further plans

- Design the `GET /uploads/{id}/history` in `openapi.yaml` and issue a PR.
- Add any other small bug fixes or changes to the same PR if related to the same functionality.
- Create a `Show Jobs` page in the react UI.
