## Roadblocks / hurdles

- Since, I am using a _**macOS**_ based system, As quoted by the mentors --- fossology isn't compatible with macOS, It has to be a linux distribution (ubuntu/fedora).
- With lots of research, I finally decided to install a virtual machine. Most of the virtual machines weren't compatible with the `arm` architecture.
- Finally I got one VM service which was supported in my system. It is called [**UTM**](https://mac.getutm.app/).
- After setting up UBUNTU 22.04 on my **VM**, and installing all the dependencies via `sudo utils/fo-installdeps`, fossology still threw the following error,
  ![cli-error-install-fossology](/img/reactUI/api/cliError.png)

#### _P.S.~ Currently, I'm stuck here. I will be giving one more day to resolve this. If the error still persists, I'll be moving onto developing the pages in the UI Project which are not implemented._

## [UPDATED]

- Finally, I am able to do some progress. I was able to set up fossology on my machine using a local VM instance and used `ssh` for development via **vs-code**.
- Currently, I'm refering to the `OPENAPI(Swagger)` docs and trying to test the existing apis to understand the flow.

## Conclusion and further plans

- Currently, I'm designing the `addUser` API in the `openapi.yaml` file.
- In the next week, I'll be implementing `/users` POST route for creating a new user via REST API.
