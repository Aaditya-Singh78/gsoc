| Sl. No. | Initial Goals                                                         | Completed |
| ------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------- |
| 1.      | Solve requested changes on existing PRs                               | Done      |
| 2.      | Finish the implementation of REST API for modifying upload Permssions | Done      |

## REST API Implemented -

After designing the API in the previous weaek, the design was approved by **Gaurav** Sir and requested some final changes. So, following the API design I implemented the `PUT /uploads/{id}/permissions` api for modifying the upload permissions via REST API.

### `uploadPermssions` :

- The API implementation of the `/uploads/{id}/permissions` PUT route to modify user Details is done.
- This task included
  - Creating a new PUT route in the `index.php` file inside `www/ui/api` directory.
  - Adding a new method `setUploadPermissions` in the `UploadController`class.
  - Trying to re-use the methods that are already used in the `upload_permissions` plugin.
  - Testing the API via any API platform like **postman**.

### PR Link : [feat(api): PUT api to Set permissions for a upload and GET API to fetch respective permissions of groups #2275](https://github.com/fossology/fossology/pull/2275)

## Testing `/uploads/{id}/permissions`

- Pull the changes from the above **PR**.
- Use any API platform like **postman**.
- Provide the request body as following ----
  ![req-body-upload-permissions](/img/reactUI/api/uploadPermReq.png)

- You can expect a response like this
  ![res-upload-permissions](/img/reactUI/api/uploadPermRes.png)

## UI Implementation of the upload permissions page

When I started examining the UI behaviour of the upload permssions page, I realised that there is a requirement of an API that should return all the groups with their respective permissions for a given upload in order to create a tabular view in the UI.

## Conclusions and further plans

- This PR is currently in review and if any changes are requested, I'll be solving them in the coming week.
- Implement and design the API that will return the groups with their respective permissions for a given upload ID.
- Implementing the react UI for the upload permissions page.
