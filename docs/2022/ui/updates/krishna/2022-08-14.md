## REST API Implemented -

As the below API is a part of the **upload-permissions** functionality, I added the REST implementation in the same [PR#2275](https://github.com/fossology/fossology/pull/2275).

### Designing `GET /uploads/{id}/perm-groups`

I figured out the requirements of this API and designed the following :

```
/uploads/{id}/perm-groups:
    parameters:
      - name: id
        required: true
        description: Id of the upload
        in: path
        schema:
          type: integer
    get:
      operationId: getGroupsWithPermissions
      tags:
        - Upload
      summary: Get all the groups with their respective permissions for a upload
      description:
        Returns the list of all the groups with their respective permissions for a upload
      responses:
        '200':
          description: Get Groups with permissions
          content:
            application/json:
              schema:
                $ref: '#/components/schemas/UploadPermGroups'
        '404':
          description: Upload does not exist
          content:
            application/json:
              schema:
                type: array
                items:
                  $ref: '#/components/schemas/Info'
        default:
          $ref: '#/components/responses/defaultResponse'
```

### Implementation :

- The API implementation of the `/uploads/{id}/perm-groups` GET route to get all the groups with their respective permissions for a upload is done.
- This task included
  - Creating a new GET route in the `index.php` file inside `www/ui/api` directory.
  - Adding a new method `getGroupsWithPermissions` in the `UploadController`class.
  - Trying to re-use the methods that are already used in the `upload_permissions` plugin.
  - Testing the API via any API platform like **postman**.

### PR Link : [feat(api): PUT api to Set permissions for a upload and GET API to fetch respective permissions of groups #2275](https://github.com/fossology/fossology/pull/2275)

## Testing `GET /uploads/{id}/perm-groups`

- Pull the changes from the above **PR**.
- Use any API platform like **postman**.
- Provide the `uploadId` in `params` ({id})

- If your upload exists, you can expect a response like this.
  ![res-perm-groups](/img/reactUI/api/permGroupsRes.png)
  **Note: The above response also gives the `publicPerm` parameter which states the public permissions of the upload.**

## Conclusions and further plans

- This PR is currently in review and if any changes are requested, I'll be solving them in the coming week.
- Creating the upload permissions page in the react UI and implementing the APIs created.
