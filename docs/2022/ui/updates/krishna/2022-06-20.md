### Add user page

_(19th June, 2022)_

- I completed the **UI Implementation** of Add User page.
- This task involved
  - Reusing already created components to maintain uniformity in design.
  - Using the existing API modules wherever needed.
  - Writing clean and documented code with uniformity in folder structure.
  - Since the REST API for adding a user is not available, creating a mock api request using `setTimeout` function.

### Demo video

The video clearly demonstrates the UI implementation of Add user page.

### This implementaion can be tested by pulling the changes from PR[**#229**](https://github.com/fossology/FOSSologyUI/pull/229).
