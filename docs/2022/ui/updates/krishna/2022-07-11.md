## Adding a user via REST API

- The API implementation of the `/users` POST route to create a new user is done.
- This task included
  - Creating a new POST route in the `index.php` file inside `www/ui/api` directory.
  - Adding a new method `AddUser` in the `UserController` class.
  - Trying to re-use the methods that are already used in the static UI.
  - Testing the API via any API platform like **postman**.

### PR Link : [feat(API): `users/` POST route for adding a new user #2256](https://github.com/fossology/fossology/pull/2256)

## Testing the PR

- Pull the changes from the above **PR**.
- Use any API platform like **postman**.
- Provide the request body as following ----
  ![req-body-add-user](/img/reactUI/api/reqbodyAddUser.png)

- You can expect a response like this
  ![req-body-add-user](/img/reactUI/api/resAddUser.png)

## Conclusions and further plans

- After reviewing my PR, [**Gaurav**](https://github.com/GMishx) sir pointed out few issues in the current contribution and code changes. Some of these were ----
  - There was duplication of code in the `AddUser` method as there was no way to re-use the existing functions according to me.
  - **Gaurav** sir cleared the misconception that I had, and suggested to **_patch_** the existing `add-user` page to adapt the `DefaultPlugin` rather than `FO_Plugin`.
    - Link to the discussion - https://github.com/fossology/fossology/pull/2256#discussion_r920026585
  - Since there were errors while migrating the plugin from `FO_Plugin` to `DefaultPlugin`, It was decided in the **UI Meeting** that any further changes to this PR is paused for now untill we find a **_patch_** for this.
- So, next week I'll be picking up the implementaion of REST API for modifying user Details.
