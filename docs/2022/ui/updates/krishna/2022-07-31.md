## API Docs (`POST /users`)

I completed writing the docs for the `/users` POST route in the swagger `openapi.yaml` file and it looked like mentioned below ---

    ```
    /users:
        post:
            operationId: createUser
            tags:
            - User
            - Admin
            summary: Create a new user
            description: >
            Create a new user
            requestBody:
            required: true
            content:
                application/json:
                schema:
                    allOf:
                    - $ref: '#/components/schemas/User'
                    - type: object
                        properties:
                        user_pass:
                            type: string
                        defaultVisibility:
                            type: string
                            enum:
                            - public
                            - protected
                            - private
                        required:
                        - name
                application/x-www-form-urlencoded:
                schema:
                    allOf:
                    - $ref: '#/components/schemas/User'
                    - type: object
                        properties:
                        user_pass:
                            type: string
                        defaultVisibility:
                            type: string
                            enum:
                            - public
                            - protected
                            - private
                        required:
                        - name
            responses:
            '201':
                description: User created successfully
                content:
                application/json:
                    schema:
                    $ref: '#/components/schemas/Info'
            '409':
                description: User with the same email or username already exists
                content:
                application/json:
                    schema:
                    $ref: '#/components/schemas/Info'
            '500':
                description: Internal server error with details
                content:
                application/json:
                    schema:
                    $ref: '#/components/schemas/Info'
            default:
                $ref: '#/components/responses/defaultResponse'
    ```

## Exploring upload-permissions plugin and designing the API

- I took some time to understand the functionality of the `upload-permssions` plugin's methods and explored the existing functionalities.
- I realised how the format of the request body should be by monitoring the network logs
  ```
   mod: upload_permissions
   folder: 1
   upload: 3
   alluploadsperm: 0
   newperm: 0
   newgroup: 5
  ```
- So if we observe the parameters, we see that we need the `folderId`, `uploadId`, `allUploadsPermission` for setting a common permision for every upload in a folder, `newperm` for setting up the new permission for the upload and `newGroup` which is the group Id for which the permissons are being set.

- Keeping the above factors in mind, the API design comes out to be something like mentioned below.
  ```
  /uploads/{id}/permissions:
  parameters:
    - name: id
      required: true
      description: Enter any upload id
      in: path
      schema:
        type: integer
  put:
    operationId: setUploadPermissions
    tags:
      - Upload
    summary: Set permissions for a upload in a folder for different groups
    description: >
      Set permissions for a upload in a folder for different groups
    requestBody:
      content:
        application/json:
          schema:
            type: object
            properties:
              folderId:
                type: integer
                description: Enter a folder id
              allUploadsPermission:
                type: boolean
                enum:
                - true
                - false
                description: Apply same permissions to all uploads in this folder
              groupId:
                type: integer
                description: Enter the id of the group you want to add or edit permission for this upload
              newPermission:
                type: string
                enum:
                - none
                - read_only
                - read_write
                - clearing_admin
                - admin
                description: Select the permission for selected group
              publicPermission:
                type: string
                enum:
                - none
                - read_only
                - read_write
                - clearing_admin
                - admin
                description: Select the public permission for this upload
            required:
              - allUploadsPermission
    responses:
      '202':
        description: Permissions updated successfully
        content:
          application/json:
            schema:
              type: array
              items:
                $ref: '#/components/schemas/Info'
      '400':
        description: Bad Request
        content:
          application/json:
            schema:
              type: array
              items:
                $ref: '#/components/schemas/Info'
      '404':
        description: Upload does not exist
        content:
          application/json:
            schema:
              type: array
              items:
                $ref: '#/components/schemas/Info'
      '503':
        description: Scheduler is not running
        content:
          application/json:
            schema:
              type: array
              items:
                $ref: '#/components/schemas/Info'
      default:
        $ref: '#/components/responses/defaultResponse'
  ```

## Conclusions and further plans

- Get the API design approved by the mentors and start working on the implementation.
- Study the UI behaviour of the `upload-permissions` page and realise the requirements of the UI implementaion in react.
