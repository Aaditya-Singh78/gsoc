### Edit user page

- The UI implementation of the `Edit user Page` is almost done.
- The task included
  - Reusing already created components to maintain uniformity in design.
  - Using the existing API modules wherever needed.
  - Writing clean and documented code with uniformity in folder structure.
  - Since the REST API for editing a user is not available, creating a mock api request using `setTimeout` function.
  - Pre-Populating data for the selected user whose data needs to be edited.
  - Creating an Api request function to fetch user details based on `id`.
  - Designing a `Pop-up modal` to reveal the tokens (**better UX**).

### (**Updated**) Demo video

The video clearly demonstrates the UI implementation of Edit user page.

### (**Updated**) This implementaion can be tested by pulling the changes from PR[**#236**](https://github.com/fossology/FOSSologyUI/pull/236).
