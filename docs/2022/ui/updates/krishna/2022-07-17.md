## REST APIs Implemented -

### `editUserDetails` :

- The API implementation of the `/users/{id}` PUT route to modify user Details is done.
- This task included
  - Creating a new PUT route in the `index.php` file inside `www/ui/api` directory.
  - Adding a new method `editUser` in the `UserController`class.
  - Trying to re-use the methods that are already used in the static UI.
  - Testing the API via any API platform like **postman**.

## `createRestApiToken` and `getTokens`

- The API implementation of the `/users/tokens` POST route for creating a REST API Token and `/users/tokens/{type}` GET route for getting all the REST API Tokens based on type `active | expired` is done.
- This task included
  - Creating a new POST route in the `index.php` file inside `www/ui/api` directory for creating a REST API Token.
  - Creating a new GET route in the `index.php` file inside `www/ui/api` directory for getting all the REST API Tokens based on type `active | expired`.
  - Adding new methods `createRestApiToken` and `getTokens` in the `UserController` class.
